(I've Been) Waiting (So Long)
============================================================
I've been waiting so long, oh so long.
Get out and show yourself.
I've been waiting so long for this moment to arrive.
Why don't you come out of your can.
============================================================
02-75
============================================================
I got your letter
And I read what it said
And I blushed with recognition
At every word you said
And you are my best friend
And I have always known you

I dreamed of your house
And I looked around
And I saw the real rain, real power rolling down
And you, you are my best friend
And I, I have always known you
============================================================
15-1
============================================================
If I had a car and you were riding in it
I'd show you what my car could do
I'd head east out highway fifteen and see the
Starlight shower over you
Gas fumes rising from the blacktop
Cheap motels with flashing signs
Just an old sweet song made new
And oozing through the pines

If I had thirty dollars and I could make time stop
And the moon was high up above
And moonbeams fell like sweet cream
Then the night air would carry our dark dreams
Gas fumes rising on the highway
Neon flashing everywhere
Just an old sweet song made new by your body
And desert flowers blooming in the thick night air
============================================================
15-2
============================================================
Those may be the most beautiful shades of red I've ever seen
Those may be the most beautiful shades of red I've ever seen
But don't be fooled
If the sun goes down on us here tonight
It's not gonna be alright anymore

None of this has anything really to do with us, that's my belief
As the desert sky throws the glowing neon into bold relief
Your mouth is open and your eyes are wide
Hold on because it's dark outside, yeah

The smell of roses comes thickly through the open window now
The smell of roses comes thickly through the open window now
And as the darkness closes in, our bodies draw the roses in
And those may be the most beautiful shades of red I've ever seen
============================================================
1 John 4:16
============================================================
In the holding tank I built for myself it's feeding time
And I start to feel afraid 'cause I'm the last one left in line
The endless string of summer storms that led me to today
Began one afternoon with you long ago and faraway
And someone leads the beast in on its chain
But I know you're thinking of me 'cause it's just about to rain

So I won't be afraid of anything ever again

In the cell that holds my body back the door swings wide
And I feel like someone's lost child as the guards lead me outside
And if the clouds are gathering, it's just to point the way
To an afternoon I spent with you when it rained all day
And someone leads the beast in on its chain
But I know you're thinking of me 'cause it's just about to rain

So I won't be afraid of anything ever again
============================================================
1 Samuel 15:23
============================================================
I became a crystal healer and my ministry was to the sick
Creeping vines would send out runners and seek me in their numbers
I sold self-help tapes
Go down to the netherworld, plant grapes

And as word spread of my powers they would seek me far and wide
All sad faces at my window I would welcome them inside
I sewed clothes for them: cloaks and capes
Go down to the netherworld, plant grapes

My house will be for all people who have nowhere to go
My supply of shining crystals a shield against the snow
There's more like me where I come from, so mark our shapes
Go down to the netherworld, plant grapes

2/3 Jim's Head
============================================================
Jim cut his head off with a barbed wire
You can't go ninety degrees at a hundred and five miles an hour
And return to my covenant lest I smite thee with a curse
Jim cut his head off in the barbed wire, woohoo

Jim caught himself singing church hymns
He didn't mind 'cause his body was behind him
And this is the day that the Lord has made
Yes, Jim cut his head off in the barbed wire, ah-hah

Jim took a mistress in midair
He took his mistress down into the boudoir
Fed her mandarins and chablis straight from his mouth
And said something French about her hair, wahoo

You can't go ninety degrees at a hundred and five miles per hour
This is the day that the lord has made
Yes, Jim cut his head off in the barbed wire

Jim took his clothes off so he could drive faster than the devil
He could drive faster in a Trans Am, he's a godspeeder
What the hell

In the front seat at about four in the morning
Something came down without much warning
It was bright and shiny and real nice
And it prepared us both for the sacrifice
I know what it is and I know what it means
But it's got wings
I know what it is and I know what it means
But it's got wings

In the front seat, you know what I mean
That thing came down on us bright and hot and pure and clean and ready
Ready for the kill, and I'll get ready
But hold my hand, would you please hold me steady
I know what it is and I know what it means
But it's got wings
I know what it is and I know what it means
But it's got wings

Abandoned Flesh
============================================================
Robert Smith is secure at his villa in France
Any child knows how to do the spiderweb dance
Siouxsie has enough hits to keep the bills paid
Every New Year's in Los Angeles, you can still see Richard Blade

But the world forgot about Gene Loves Jezebel
Yes the world forgot about Gene Loves Jezebel

They charted once or twice
They were on a major label
When the singer went solo
He left money on the table
The two main guys are related
They're at war with each other
Now there's two Genes loving Jezebel
One for each brother

But the world came to agree
What you see is what you get and what you get is what you see
Whether you're The March Violets or The Bolshoi
Bands who had to leave the darkness for the sun
Red Lorry Yellow Lorry were on Cherry Red I think
They've been playing clubs since 1981
To be fair to Gene Loves Jezebel
Billy Corgan brought them onstage
It was in 2011
It's on their Wikipedia page
But for the most part
However big that chorused bass may throb
You and me and all of us
Are going to have to find a job

Because the world will never know or understand
The suffocated splendor
Of the once and future goth band
============================================================
Abandoning My Father Talking Blues
============================================================
It was 9 A.M. when the U-Haul came
And I heard my momma call my name
My daddy taught English at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo
He was at work that day, it was time to go
We were moving on

I was five years old and my sister was three
I was wondering what would likely become of me
My sister looked sad and I tried to be strong
It was hard just to get up and move along
We were moving

But by five in the afternoon we were gone
And my stepfather welcomed me with open arms
We walked (strolled?) right through that apartment door
I had never lived in an apartment before
And it was weird

I'll probably never know what it was like that night
For my dad, but I'd wager it was pretty bad
My sister and me, we stayed up late
Talking in the dark and not feeling so great

We were moving out of our house
Into somebody else's place
Into a two-story apartment complex
With a swing set and a sandbox in the middle of a parking lot
And a laundry room with four glistening washing machines
And two dryers
Keep the home fires burning
Keep the home fires burning
Keep the home, home fires burning
============================================================
Abide with Me
============================================================
Abide with me, fast falls the even tide
The darkness deepens, Lord with me abide
When other helpers fail and comforts flee
Help of the helpless, Lord abide with me

Swift to its close, ebbs out life's little day
Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away
Change and decay in all around I see
O thou who changest not, abide with me
============================================================
Absolute Lithops Effect
============================================================
After one long season of waiting
After one long season of wanting
I am breaking open
My insides are pink and raw
And it hurts me when I move my jaw
But I am taking tiny steps forward
And I, I feel sure that my wounds will heal
And I, I will bloom here in my room
With a little water
And a little bit of sunlight
And a little bit of tender mercy
Tender
mercy

The big trucks come up the highway
And the big wheels rattle my windows
And night, night comes to Texas
After one blind season alone in here
After one long sweltering summer
I, I'm going to find the exit
And I will go to the house of a friend I know
And I will let myself forget
With a little water
And a little bit of sunlight
And a little bit of tender mercy
Tender
mercy
============================================================
Accentuate the Positive
============================================================
You've got to accentuate the positive
Eliminate the negative
Latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with Mr. In-Between
You've got to spread joy out to the maximum
Keep gloom down to the minimum
Have faith or pandemonium
Likely to burst upon the scene
To illustrate my last remark
Jonah in the whale, Noah in the ark
What did they do just when everything seemed so dark?
They said, man you gotta accentuate the positive
Eliminate the negative
Latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with Mr. In-Between
Nah, don't mess with Mr. In-Between
I mean, don't mess with Mr. In-Between
============================================================
Acceptable Damages Sutra
============================================================
I had some high hopes, had some high hopes
For the coming year
But as it turns out
Nothing ever really changes here
But when I've had
About as much as I can take
When I feel myself
Just about to break
I lean into the wind
And like an infant, I reach out for your hand
Fool me once, you know
Shame shame
Shame shame

And as we rehearse our scene
We really put our hearts into it
And I feel an opening to wiggle through
But I don't want to do it
But some habits are hard to break, hard to break
And some aren't really habits anymore
And when the full force of the hurricane
Nearly knocks me on the floor
I lean into the wind
And like an infant, I reach out for your hand
Fool me once, you know
Shame shame
Shame shame
============================================================
Adair
============================================================
I got my eye on the scar
That runs clear from your temple to your jawline
If you'll tell me about all your thoughts right this minute
Then I will tell you mine

'Cause I got the wind in my hair
And I'm far away from where I used to be
But I got all my attention fixed on you
And you're flashing that smile at me

With the Midwestern sky burning above us
We lean up against the car
I wanna tell you what the sky has done to me
I want you to tell me who we are
'Cause I see him raising the water to your lips
It's the blazing dead center of July
And I got all my hopes hung on your one gorgeous promise
And you got the sunlight dancing on your eyes

And I got the wind in my hair
And I'm far away from where I used to be
But I got all my attention fixed on you
And you're just where you said you'd be
Just where you said you'd be
============================================================
Adultery
============================================================
There's a mean streak in the sky
On the morning when you come by
And you ask me "would I?"
And I say I would
And it's an ill wind that does nobody good

And I should've known that you'd come my way
By the dogs sprawled out sleeping on the driveway
Windows open audibly around the neighborhood
It's an ill wind that does nobody good

And you touched my hand
And the sun bleeds down
Ineffective warnings all over the ground
And I'm standing on the same spot where you husband stood
It's an ill wind that does nobody good
============================================================
Against Agamemnon
============================================================
Red red, red everywhere
Bright red all along the thin canvas wall
I stepped outside for a little air
I stepped outside to get away from it all
I went out through the front and saw the purple sky
Making jokes about my condition

I am going for a walk
I'll be back in half an hour
Watch over the children
I'll be back in half an hour
Hey hey la la la
Hey hey la la la

Against Pollution
============================================================
When I worked down at the liquor store
Guy with a shotgun came raging through the place
Muscled his way behind the counter
I shot him in the face

This morning I went down to the Catholic church
'Cause something just came over me
Forty-five minutes in the pews
Praying the rosary
When the last days come
We shall see visions
More vivid than sunsets
Brighter than stars
We will recognize each other
And see ourselves for the first time
The way we really are

Decorative grating on my window
Gets a little rustier every year
I don't know how the metal gets rusty
When it never rains here

A year or so ago I worked at a liquor store
And a guy came in
Tried to kill me, so I shot him in the face
I would do it again
I would do it again
When the last days come
We shall see visions
More vivid than sunsets
Brighter than stars
We will recognize each other
And see ourselves for the first time
The way, the way we really are
============================================================
Age of Kings
============================================================
Halls of the stone tower in the foothills
Why should we hide from anyone?
Held you in my arms
for the first time that day
Felt like God's anointed when
you didn't push me away

Gold light shining on so many things
In the age of kings
Gold light shining on so many things
In the age of kings

Lean on the concrete walls in shadow
Why should we wait to throw the switch?
Felt your name burn in
like a tattoo into my skin
Rain on the clay tiles all night
Your head nestled beneath my chin

Gold light shining on so many things
In the age of kings
Gold light shining on so many things
In the age of kings

In the lost age
Where the jewels hide
And sword sticks in the waiting stone
Still warm

Small chambers shrinking till they vanish
Wolves in the hallway gaining ground
Reach down to the moment when
I should've said something true
Shadows and their sources
now stealing away with you

Gold light shining on so many things
In the age of kings
Gold light shining on so many things
In the age of kings

Agemo's Hoops
============================================================
You were breathing against my throat
Covering your laugh up with your long black overcoat
All circuits warming up
And you told me what you were going to do
And I promised to do the same thing too
And the air, the air in New England was pure
Poison

The car was parked out back among the trees
Your voice was getting higher by slow degrees
You were giving me directions
And you told me where I came from
Well God bless us, every one
And the air, the air in New England was pure
Poison, poison, poison, poison
============================================================
Ain't Misbehavin'
============================================================
No one to talk with
All by myself
No one to walk with
But I'm happy on the shelf
Ain't misbehavin'
Savin' my love for you

I know for certain
The one I love
I'm through with flirtin'
It's you that I'm thinkin' of
Ain't misbehavin'
Savin' my love for you

Like Jack Horner
In the corner
I don't go nowhere
What do I care?
Your kisses are worth waitin' for
Believe me

I don't stay out late
I don't care to go
I'm home about eight
It's me and my radio
Ain't misbehavin'
Savin' my love for you

Ain't misbehavin'
Savin' my love for you
============================================================
Alabama Nova
============================================================
Your house is depressing
Your house is dirty
Why don't you come outside a little while
Why don't you step out into the sun
Let me take you down
Let me ease you around Montgomery

And out there on the front porch
Your hair shines in the sun
And I can see the sun gathering on your eyes
What the hell are you looking at
Let me take you down
Let me ease you around Montgomery
============================================================
Alagemo
============================================================
The new rose floating on water in the old clay bowl
The white clouds on night sky
The way they just roll on by
Made me think of you
And the religious cult of flesh dissolution you've committed yourself to
Alagemo
Alagemo

The night crawlers poking their little slimy heads through the dirt
Made me think of you again
Made me think of you a third time
I don't know where you've gone
But I hear your voice droning on
Alagemo
Alagemo
============================================================
Alibi
============================================================
I got off work just past eleven
Laid one finger to the breeze
You can almost taste the action
On nights like these
Trees were bending in the wind
You were forty miles away
And I was headed in your direction
I've been waiting all day, I've been waiting all day

Moon over West Covina was huge and white
And I was like a patient on a table
Headed for the light
Lean toward the center divider
Feel the wind in my hair
Keep a light up in your window
I'm gonna be right there, I'm gonna be right there

With a gleam in my eye
And an almost airtight alibi

Down by the chemistry building
I found a quiet place to park
And I made my way down the street toward your place
Stepping lightly in the dark
Climbed the steps up to your doorway
Like a man prepared to jump beneath a train
It's real warm outside tonight
Maybe tomorrow it rains, maybe tomorrow it rains

Inside your room we shut the window
And we turned on a fan
And we lay there together in the darkness
I can keep a secret if you can
Finishing one another's sentences
Like a pair of identical twins
Your boyfriend's out of town until Tuesday
And nobody saw me come in, nobody saw me come in

With a gleam in my eye
And an almost airtight alibi
============================================================
All Devils Here Now
============================================================
On humid evenings you have heard
Your neighbors making noises
That you wonder for awhile about
And then put off investigating
Shrieks and squeals and high-pitched whines and we
We are your neighbors

In hazy afternoons you've watched
Your neighbors come and go
And maybe stay away a day or two
And then return appearing worse for wear
Scratched up and hollow-eyed, you tried
Your best to ignore us

You see us at the grocery store
You wonder what we're shopping for
We lean against the Thermador
Eyes fixed firmly on the floor
Pomona's big as all outdoors and we
We are your neighbors
============================================================
All Frosting
============================================================
Let's meet out in San Bernardino
Let's get a case of Polish vodka
Let's bring out the big guns
The modified Israeli ones

Let's go back to where we let it all go
Let's quit scavenging for bones down in the snow
Let's follow the freeway from here
Let's disappear

Let's get our stuff back from the pawnshop
Let's put a bedroom in the attic
Let's stay up real late
And see if we don't suffocate

Let's practice our smiles 'til we're both freezing cold
Let's dig up the graveyard 'til we find ourselves some gold
I will tell you when the coast has come clear
Let's disappear
============================================================
All Rooms Cable A/C Free Coffee
============================================================
Wine and honey, lipstick and spit
You coming through the door with a cigarette lit
And I'm not supposed to think your death wish is cool
But then I see you knocking back tequilas by the pool
And I am a yellow rose, growing near the ground
Waiting to climb something

Sweat and water, muscle and blood
Hints about as subtle as a flash flood
Sky over California all pink and white
Something's gonna happen somewhere tonight
I am a yellow rose, growing near the ground
Waiting to climb something

Thunder, lightning, hot rain
Sweet smell of rotten grain
Holy basil, wolf's bane
Crows tapping on the windowpane
I am a yellow, yellow rose, growing near the ground
Waiting to climb something
============================================================
All Up the Seething Coast
============================================================
I eat a couple Milky Ways for breakfast
I take my coffee light and sweet
Show up for dinner when you tell me to
And I heap the sugar high and white on everything I eat

Carry an apple in my pocket
I write reminders on my skin
Clip meaningless pictures from old magazines
I tape them to the walls, it's a bad place I'm in

And nothing you can say or do will stop me
And a thousand dead friends can't stop me

I go back to places I remember
See what's been going on without me
Stare down the strangers at the bus stop
Pretend they've been gossiping about me

White sugar by the spoonful
And cantaloupes and grapes and watermelons
I force it down like it was medicine
Anybody asks, you tell 'em what you wanna tell 'em
But the best you've got is powerless against me
And all your little schemes break when they come crashing up against me, ah-ha
============================================================
All of You
============================================================
all of you in waiting
all of you in hand
all of you who fall back
all of you who stand
all of you in favor
all whose names have been brought low
all of you from great to humble
all of you must go

all of you must die
all of you must die
all of you must die, die begging for one more day
all of you must die

all of you who come from plenty
all of you whose fare was lean
all of you with dirty faces
all of you whose hands are clean
you who cast your lots with tommy
you who got your hands dirty with dave
all of you can stop digging now
and climb down into your grave

all of you must die
all of you must die
all of you must die, die begging for one more day
all of you must die

and i do mean every last one
we're gonna have a whole team of accountants on hand to check the math when the numbering's done

all of you before me
all of you behind
all of you who hope one day to see your good deeds repaid in kind
all of you who feel reflective
all of you who feel forlorn
feel free to gaze down into the precipice as naked as the day you were born

all of you must die
all of you must die
all of you must die, die begging for one more day
all of you must die
all of you must die, die begging for one more day
all of you must die
DIE!
============================================================
Almost Every Door
============================================================
Cower in the corner
Try hard to disappear
The moment's never going to come
When anyone can say that the coast is clear

Maybe turn around
Find a wall to break your fist on
Almost every door's an exit
Just not this one

Dream about the outside
Sprinting down the open plain
Barefoot and outclassed
Bloody up the broken grain

Every cartoon gag
TNT and nitroglycerin
Almost every door's an exit
Just not this one

Pause before each door
Like a sinner lost in prayer
Always one more hallway
At the bottom of the stair

I get knocked down
But I get up again like a dunce
Cave's all sealed up
Nowhere to hide out in the winter months

Aiming for the blackout
Spare a prayer for souls in prison
Almost every door's an exit
Just not this one
============================================================
Alpha Aquae
============================================================
I've grown rather tired
Of our little game
You ask me the question
My answer's the same
And I couldn't say the day or the year
But it must be summer, 'cause there's flies in here
I need water
I need water

Ants on the window ledge caught my attention
And I wanted to say so, but I was too tired to mention it
And we crawled in bed and melted together
Cursing each other
Cursing the weather
And I need water
I need water
============================================================
Alpha Chum Gatherer
============================================================
Rise up real early shaking
Try and steady my hand
Make my way down to the water
Sail a half a mile from land

See where the sharks have been feeding
Out on the ocean alone
And I scrutinize the carnage
Like it was the goddamn Rosetta Stone

When I crack
That secret code
It's sure to lighten my load

Won’t you come out sailing with me
Into the warmth of the afternoon

Scoop up the guts and brains
Drizzle them into a plastic bag
Watch them drop onto the deck
Feel the day drag

And when I get back to the car
It's like a furnace inside
I head on down the highway
Throttle open wide

Back home in the high heat
I spill out all my presents for you
There's blood all over the floor now
What are we going to do

Won't you come out sailing with me
Into the warmth
Warmth of the afternoon

Alpha Compunction
============================================================
You will not call my memory into question
You will not question my memory
See there was you and me up on a hilltop by ourselves
And then the red clouds dispersing above me
I should have killed myself
When I found out how beautiful you are
But everyone makes mistakes sometimes

As the afternoon sky opened up its mouth
And the air cooled down one or two degrees
I felt the world within me screaming to come out
and then I looked up at you and your hair spilled down over me

I felt you breathing on me and I heard your voice
Your eyes were twin bonfires and your lips were moist
I should have killed myself
When I found out how beautiful you are
But everyone makes mistakes sometimes
============================================================
Alpha Desperation March
============================================================
I'm coming in
Try to stop me
Push furniture in front of the door
It only gives me something to push against
In the full heat of the summer's day
You're telling me to go away
But you owe me eight-thousand dollars
And I can use it

I'm only getting stronger
You may have noticed
But a head full of memories propels me ever forward
And in the living room I don't see where you are
But the back door's locked so you can't have gone far
And eight thousand dollars is a whole lot of money
And I could use it

Could be that it's my imagination
But I think I hear you now
So come out come out, wherever you are
Olly olly olly olly olly olly oxen free
See I'm perfectly aware of where our love stands
But the plain fact is that you owe me eight grand
If it helps to jog your memory
I lent it to you one Tuesday when we were drinking

Ha!
ha-ha-ha-uh-uh-ha!
Uh-ha! uh-ha! uh uh uh-ha!
Uh-ha! ha ha ha
Ha ha ha
Uh-ha
Uh-ha
Uh-ha

Alpha Double Negative: Going to Catalina
============================================================
I hear you starting up again
I see you standing on the deck
I hear your voice start to carry
I see the veins throbbing in your neck

And I know what you're saying
And I know what you're saying it for
But I'm not listening
I'm not listening anymore

And I see you come toward me
I see the sun climb down the sky
I hear your voice getting faster and louder
I see a stranger in your eyes

And I know what you're saying
And I know what you're saying it for
But I'm not listening
I'm not listening anymore

Alpha Gelida
============================================================
Popcorn was snapping in the hot oil on the kitchen stove
And the sky through the kitchen window was cold and poised and threatening
Heard your voice come lilting through the wall
I heard your voice come sailing from the other room

Let the young lions come
Let me break their jaws
Let the young lions come out
Let me break their jaws with my bare fingers

Coffee was dripping through the paper filter cone
The hip scent of it nearly knocked me out
I heard your voice come lilting through the back of the refrigerator
Heard your voice come breaking through the wall

Let the young lions come out
Let me talk them out of it
Let the young lions come
Let me break their jaws with my bare fingers

Alpha Incipiens
============================================================
The morning comes to a stuttering halt
The cool breeze that blows is somebody's fault
The summer heat tries to burn through
And I look over to warn you but something's happening

The morning glories climb the wall
And you speak in a slow drawl
I'm trying to piece together what you're saying
But the birds are screeching, the hounds are baying
I don't remember there being any hounds around here

We lean back and we clink our glasses
Raise the drinks to our thirsty mouths
And thick as molasses ice cold vodka eases in as
The low pressure system brings the breezes in
And they sashay and pirouette above you
The only thing I know is that I love you
And I'm holding on
Yeah
============================================================
Alpha Negative
============================================================
The house was pretty and the yard was wide
And I felt strong with you at my side
Your eyes at night had a beautiful glowing in them
And I knew in my heart just what was growing in them

Ah, but you made me drink poison
It felt smooth running down my throat
I love you, and you made me drink poison
It was cool and smooth and sweet
Do you remember?

We had a bed of daisies thriving in the yard
And I quit my job, so I could hold you all the time
I tried to stop the thing metastasizing in us
But in the warm, slow evening
I could feel it rising in us

Ah, and you made me drink poison
It felt so smooth sliding down my throat
I love you so much, and you made me drink poison
It was cool and smooth and sweet and cool
And smooth and sweet and cool and smooth

Alpha Omega
============================================================
On the morning you went away
The air was humid and the sky was gray
I had boiled peanuts for breakfast from Cairo, Georgia

The air was wet, my face was wetter
The pink flowers along the western window made me feel better
I turned the air conditioner on
Found the note on scented stationary - you were long gone
I had boiled peanuts for breakfast from Cairo, Georgia

I popped the top off of the aluminum can
Let the brine slide down my fingers, man
It was warm, it was warm on my skin
But I felt the cold blast looming on in
I had boiled peanuts for breakfast from Cairo, Georgia

Alpha Rats Nest
============================================================
Ah the lengthening hours and the refinery
Belching fire into the sky
We do our best vampire routines
As we suck the dying hours dry
The night is lovely as a rose
If I see sunlight hit you
I am sure that we'll both decompose

Ah the fitful sleep and the fire engines
That I dream of when I dream
Some day we'll both wake up for good
I will try hard not to scream
The evening wind will shake the blinds
You're stirring from your slumber
We've got something hateful on our minds

Oh sing sing sing
For the dying of the day
Sing for the flames that will rip through here
And the smoke that will carry us away
Yeah sing for the damage we've done
And the worse things that we'll do
Open your mouth up and sing for me now
And I will sing for you
============================================================
Alpha Sun Hat
============================================================
You say again that nothing's wrong
I'd really like to play along
Your ruby red mouth is full and moist
I'd like to give in to your oboe reed voice
But as sure as those are buzzards in the guava tree
You're looking real funny at me

1 2 3 4,
That's not music you hear, that's the devil
That's not the sun up in the sky, it's a human heart
If you're planning your escape, you know I'm all for you
As I watch the sun come up again over Tallahassee, Florida
============================================================
Alpha in Tauris
============================================================
My hand brushes against the lock of hair that hangs down past your ear to your jaw (2x)
It's real neat, the moment's sweet but it's all wrong

And we're pictures of decency when we wave goodbye outside
We're pictures of decency when we wave goodbye outside
Yeah, I’m the model of composure out there
But you oughta see me shaking later on

My brain gets flooded six hours later
My brain gets flooded over six hours later
Rivers run with pictures of you as I stare up at the blood red moon
Lying out front on the lawn, hey
============================================================
Alphabetizing
============================================================
The summer crawled by indetectably
And then I saw you looking down to me
And your earrings sparkled in the noonday sun
And though it's very true that I love everyone
With every ounce of energy left in me
I love you especially because

I saw you, coming through
The screen door on the second floor
Up on the balcony

It was hard to even see you at all
Because the air was thick with alcohol
So I kept on rubbing my eyes
For all the good it did me
For all the measurable good it did me
Let the years come and take away my memory
I will not forget the shock that ran through me when

I saw you, coming through
The screen door on the second floor
Up on the balcony
============================================================
Ambivalent Landscape Z
============================================================
Out where the water tower climbs, higher than God
Crop dust in billowing clouds and the outlaw corn, glinting goldenrod
Cold gaze of the universal harvester
Glittering on the horizon line
Every creature on earth needs a fallout shelter, this one's mine

I'll never see you again
So until then

Down by the Morton building where I first met you
Nothing but energy fields and their bright pink edges doing what they do all day
You threw your car keys away
You left a bunch of dummy footprints on the clay
I try to follow directions as they're printed on the tin but
I need a shelter to fallout in

I'll never see you again
So until then

Amy AKA Spent Gladiator 1
============================================================
Do every stupid thing that makes you feel alive
Do every stupid thing to try to drive the dark away
Let people call you crazy for the choices that you make
Find limits past the limits
Jump in front of trains all day
And stay alive
Just stay alive

Play with matches if you think you need to play with matches
Seek out the hidden places where the fire burns hot and bright
Find where the heat's unbearable and stay there if you have to
Don't hurt anybody on your way up to the light
And stay alive
Just stay alive

People might laugh at your tattoos
When they do get new ones in completely garish hues
I hide down in my corner because I like my corner
I am happy where the vermin play

Make up magic spells
We wear them like protective shells
Landmines on the battlefield
Find the one safe way
And stay alive
Just stay alive

An Antidote for Strychnine
============================================================
Dig around in the garbage
Save up some halibut bones in a jar
Scrape a winter's worth of salt deposits
From the rusty frame of my car
Ask the experts
Maybe they'll know

Call up my teacher in Cambridge
See what he remembers
Throw white phosphorus in the fireplace
Look for clues in the embers
Call the hotline
Give them a phony last name

Trying to find
An antidote for strychnine

Trying to find
An antidote for strychnine

Time's running short
Always seems to run shorter
Have some supplies sent
From up just past the northern border
Keep a line out
To the people who take the long view

Only share my research
With sick lab rats like me
Trapped behind the beakers
And the Erlenmeyer flasks
Cut off from the world, I may not ever get free
But I may
One day

Trying to find
An antidote for strychnine

Trying to find
An antidote for strychnine

So many suffering from the same affliction
Coming up on a breakthrough
The clock's ticking
Dig down amongst my calculations
Check my map
Up there on the surface
Everybody's getting ready for the bloodbath
Stem the tide, stem the tide
They're calling down for reinforcements

Trying to find
An antidote for strychnine

Trying to find
An antidote for strychnine

An Inscription at Salonae
============================================================
There was a guy up on the hill
With a trumpet to his lips
I mean to tell you he knew how to blow that thing

There were women dressed in purple
Banging on their tambourines
And hammering on cymbals

It was not that long ago
When we gathered in the valley below
I loved you more than I loved my own life
I was falling to pieces

There was a young man on the altar
You saw me poised above him
I saw you watching me

There were singers, there were dancers
There was glittering gold
Spring breaking out gradually

It was not that long ago
But the memory's kinda dying out, ya know
Like a flower caught in the overgrowth
Falling, falling to pieces
============================================================
Andrew Eldritch Is Moving Back to Leeds
============================================================
There's indifference on the wind
But a faint gust of hope
At a club nobody goes to
With a musty velvet rope
Guys in Motorhead jackets
Who knew him way back when
Haven't raised a drink in years
But now meet up again
To remember how it was when they all thought they'd move away
Ridin' Lotus Sevens through the London streets one day

Nobody ever gets away
Even the best of us come back someday
To the unmarked rooms where the dry dust breeds
Andrew Eldritch is moving back to Leeds

There's a rusted fog machine
In a concrete storage space
Letter-number combinations
With no meaning on its face
They won't make these anymore
It's a wooden coach-and-four
No one will even steal it if you leave it by the door
With no sign to mark its going, no tombstone for its grave
There will be goodbyes by dozens, so practice being brave

No one anticipates the rush
The breezy feeling of the faceless crush
At the end of things where the selvage bleeds
Andrew Eldritch is moving back to Leeds

They don't throw him a parade
He just comes in on a train
One suitcase in his hand
And an old army backpack
From the second World War
From a Leipzig second-hand store

Pick the keys up from the agent
Everything's been taken care of
No big changes in the roadways
Since you left, that I'm aware of
A few old buildings gone to dust
And some new ones in the way
They'll look just like the old ones when the winds have had their say
See the children bound for London
You'll all be back too
Everybody tests the membrane
But no one pushes through

Come on boys, that'll be enough
You'd think your old friends wouldn't play so tough
Like a basket by the Nile hiding down among the reeds
Andrew Eldritch is moving back to Leeds
============================================================
Animal Mask
============================================================
Eighteen-man steel cage free-for-all
Through the noise I hear you call for help
You can't protect yourself
Frog mask and yellow cape
So desperate to escape
I came to you, hands wrapped in adhesive tape
That was when we were young and green
In the dawning hours of our team

Some things you will remember
Some things stay sweet forever

Seen you backstage once or twice
Animal gimmick pops real nice
Elbows sweep and tiger dance
Little extra fighter's chance
"Hold on", I cried, "I'll be right there"
Pull your mask down through your hair
They won't see you
Not until you want them to
That was when we were green and young
Battle cry rising from your tongue

Some things you will remember
Some things stay sweet forever
============================================================
Answering the Phone
============================================================
Maybe I didn't get enough milk when I was a baby
Maybe I never learned the value of a penny
Maybe I listened to that first Black Sabbath album, the one with the witch on the front
One time too many
But I think something's wrong with me
I think something's wrong with me
I think something's glued down wrong with me permanently

Maybe it's the things I never learned how to do
Maybe it's the things I learned to do real well
Maybe it's the Irish whiskey that I like to drink
Maybe it's the California Zinfandel
But I think something's wrong with me
I think something's glued down wrong, maybe permanently

I'm gonna tell you once; you oughta listen
If you came here for comfort, you came to the wrong place
I've got a strong stomach and a murmur in my heart
I got a tremor in my hand, muscle twitches in my face
And I think something's wrong with me
I think something's maybe snapped on wrong, maybe permanently
Yep

Anti-Music Song
============================================================
I saw you on TV
Doing a bad imitation of Van Morrison
And I saw you on TV
Doing a bad imitation of a second-rate songwriter from the eighties named Morrissey
I never liked Morrissey
And I don't like you

I saw you on TV
Doing an imitation of an imitation of Jimi Hendrix
That's really pathetic
And I saw you on TV
Trying to figure out what Brian Jones would be like if he'd have lived 'til today
I can tell you myself
He'd be like Brian Wilson
I don't like Brian Wilson
And I don't like you
I don't like you

Any Available Surface
============================================================
I waved at you when you hit the disappearing point
Turned in for the night the next day around ten
I caught the sweet scent of your hair on my pillowcase
Felt so much in love, I felt like myself again
Someday the only thing I want to rely upon
Is any available surface that you've rested your head on

Back in the cave I traced the arc of our awakening
Shimmering down in the darkness like hidden gold
And I said my secret to myself out loud again
We may live to see miracles, if our faith can hold
Someday the only thing I want to rely upon
Is any available surface that you've rested your head on
============================================================
Are You Cleaning Off the Stone?
============================================================
I'd like to begin by saying that I saw you coming
But that would be a lie
I'd like to say that I could hear your voice
But I couldn't mean 'hear' in the accepted sense of the word

Are you cleaning off the stone
That's a sweet thing to do
Are you cleaning off the stone
That's sweet of you

They tell me your hair's gotten much much longer
I bet it looks nice
They tell me your eyes are the same color as they always were
That kind of information just floors me

Are you cleaning off the stone
That's a sweet thing to do
Are you cleaning off the stone
That's sweet of you

Are you cleaning off the stone
That's a sweet thing to do
Are you cleaning off the stone
That's sweet of you

Arguing With the Ghost of Peter Laughner About His Coney Island Baby Review
============================================================
Just imagine a time and place
Sentient objects adrift in space
Trying to do the needful math
Trying to find the secret path
Seas gone silent in the spiral shell
When you fell

Blazing torches to light the way
All fuel burned right up in just one day
Will there be another way?
That won't be for you to say
You who took with you the ancient spell
When you fell

Hurt too hard too long and die too young
Silver dollar glistening on your tongue

May your passage be assured
There may your foul afflictions all be cured
Systems closing down on several fronts
You will always have been here once
Cap the west's final wildcat well
When you fell
when you fell
when you fell

Armies of the Lord
============================================================
Trying to pantomime surprise
After we buried you at sunrise
With nothing you'd predicted coming true
Just doing what we'd promised we would do
Not ready any more
Late for the war

Who would prepare for peace, take up the sword
Waiting for the armies of the Lord

Even if we found the world again
Haircuts and clean clothes, and what then:
Sew ourselves clean back into the fold?
Remember til we don't, and then grow old?
Not ready to go that way
What would our old friend say?

Who goes without will find some great reward
Waiting for the armies of the Lord

And even if they never come
Stay here by the fire
Listening for the drum

In the world but not of it any more
Starving to death down by the shore
Prehistoric insects trapped in ice
Letting the hunger claim its price
Sixteen to three now down to two
Soon it'll just be you

Raise the flag and cut the cord
All aboard that's going aboard
Waiting for the armies of the Lord

As Many Candles As Possible
============================================================
When stray dogs finally catch you in the alley
You don't consider their point of view
But when the wounds are healed, and the scars are shiny,
Sometimes then you do

The terms are vicious
Time is tight
No one gets
Too much light

When you see the risen beast in your nightmares
You treat him like a long lost brother
But when you pass him on the streets of the city by day
You pretend you don't recognize each other

The lake is boiling
The fish won't bite
No one gets
Too much light

Seek out a cave by the ocean while you wait out the rain
Dial down the weak bits and crank up the gain
Listen for the prophecy somewhere in the static
Once you've saddled up your pony, burn down the paddock

When pigs gather in the sty to greet the sunrise
They all begin to squeal for joy
It doesn't sound like joy to the untrained ear
And there's plenty of distortion and it's not real clear

You've got a friend downstairs
He howls all night
No one gets
Too much light

Attention All Pickpockets

In comes you, not the same person I knew
Looking roughly the same but something hungry getting restless in your brain

Hey hey hey hey hey

So there I go, not the same person that you used to know
Peeking through the fish-eye lens at you

And the cornet blows
Where the oleander grows
And us two, not the same people that our old friends knew

And so down the street, you head, in the high summer heat
White long sleeved Oxford pushed up to just before your elbows

Black pumps and a medium length black skirt
Eating a path through the dark damp Earth
I hope they've got plenty of money where you're going

And the cornet blows
Where the oleander grows
And us two, not the same people that our old friends knew

This is called "Aulon Raid"

Arrows flying through the air
Your reputation precedes you
Something must be done
Here in the heat of the onslaught
I am the one

Me and my crew
We will deal with you
We will deal with you
Me and my pagan crew

Come to lay down the edict
Come for the spoils
Come for the temple attendants
Anointed in oils
Come flanked by your big guns
Ride with the pack
Come screaming for tribute
Go out on your back

Me and my crew
We will deal with you
We will deal with you
Me and my pagan crew, yeah, yeah

Autoclave
============================================================
Hand me your hand, let me look in your eyes
As my last chance to feel human begins to vaporize
Maybe it’s the heat in here, maybe it’s the pressure
You ought to head for the exits, the sooner the better

I am this great, unstable mass of blood and foam
And no one in her right mind would make my home her home
My heart’s an autoclave
My heart’s an autoclave

When I try to open up to you I get completely lost
Houses swallowed by the earth, windows thick with frost
And I reach deep down within, but the pathways twist and turn
And there’s no light anywhere, and nothing left to burn

And I am this great, unstable mass of blood and foam
And no emotion that’s worth having could call my heart its home
My heart’s an autoclave
My heart’s an autoclave

I dreamt that I was perched atop a throne of human skulls
On a cliff above the ocean, howling wind and shrieking seagulls
And the dream went on forever, one single static frame
Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name

And I am this great, unstable mass of blood and foam
And no one in her right mind would make her home my home
My heart’s an autoclave
My heart’s an autoclave

I don't believe I've made it clear what exactly I mean by that

Saw the bright feathers reflected in the sky, now

And I'll need your love to see me through
So please believe me, my heart is in your hands
And I'll be missing you

'Cause you know it's you babe
Whenever I get weary and I've had enough
Feel like giving up
You know it's you babe
Giving me the courage and the strength I need
Please believe
That it's true
Babe I love you

Babe I'm leaving, I'll say it once again
Somehow try to smile
I know the feeling we're trying to forget
If only for a while
But I'll be lonely without you
And I'll need your love to see me through
So please believe me, my heart is in your hands
And I'll be missing you

'Cause you know it's you babe
Whenever I get weary and I've had enough
Feel like giving up
You know it's you babe
Giving me the courage and the strength I need
Please believe
That it's you
Babe I love you
Babe I love you

'Cause you know it's you babe
Whenever I get weary and I've had enough

The sun came up above the strange white plain
Blood red flowers all wet with rain
And the spirit wasn't really willing anymore, but the flesh was very, very strong
And I've got very little money left and I've got no sense
But I'll have none of your goddamned impudence
The sun came up above the new white fields
Everything was new again
Pure power stripped of meaning
Sky burning, spring cleaning

Daisies on the hillside like cancer on the skin
Pretty little yellow eyes that flutter in the wind
I'd be grateful my children aren't here here to see this
If you'd ever seen fit to give me children
And my defenses may be working with a skeleton crew
But I'll be skinned alive before I'll take this from you
The sun came up above the ocean out west
All the colors of the rainbow

Stand up straight, you can see the house leaning
Day breaking, spring cleaning

So the sunlight plays its games along your eyes
And it has the same effect on a thousand other guys
And I’d be lying if I said I didn't feel the pull, too
But the sunlight makes me strong and I know about you

Beachfront hotel, twenty dollars a night
Nineteen seventy-two, sun yellow and bright
Too exhausted to think or to talk
Young boys from Bangladesh breakdancing on the sidewalk
And the waves will tear them all to pieces
The waves will tear them all to pieces

Twinkling Waterford crystal in the banquet hall
Childlike religious paintings lining the wall
I will try to gather my strength, and I will rest up all week
All I can say to them, yeah
When I open my mouth to speak
Is that the waves will tear us all to pieces
The waves will tear us all to pieces

Won't you take a look, take a good look at my paws

We got the badger song, it isn't very long
Sit down and listen, this will only take a minute
Badgers man, we do what we can
Everybody's gonna have to do his part
Now won't you take a look, take a good look at my paws
Take a look, take a good look at my paws

Well in Baltimore you will find what you've been waiting for
In Baltimore, you will find what you've been waiting for

Just beyond the last of the sidewalk, where the beach begins
I heard the airplanes announcing the apocalypse
Saw the 737s coming on in
Will you hold on for just a minute
Will you hold on while I catch my breath, listen
In Baltimore, you'll uncover what you're digging for
In Baltimore, you will find what you've been waiting for

Bare Grace Misery

Sweet boy, come in
I am the dark side of you
Die for my sins
Like the One once did

Cinnamon bed
For your unashamed appetite

This dance will hurt like hell

Oh, bare grace misery
Just a child without a fairytale am I
Dark but so lovely
A Little Match Girl freezing in the snow

Love lying, enticing
Bare grace misery
Crowning the moment
Bare grace misery
This is what I am
Bare grace for the end of days

When done with me
Forget if you think I feel ashamed
A wild thing
Never felt sorry for anything

Love lying, enticing
Bare grace misery
Crowning the moment
Bare grace misery
This is what I am
Bare grace for the end of days

I get letters telling me since I moved away
You've taken to hanging out on that rock about a mile from shore
And given what I know about that rock, namely that it's populated by seals
I strongly suggest to you that you not hang out there anymore

'Cause the seal is a wily and a vicious creature
And the seal will bite you if you give him half a chance
Yeah the seal has a mind set on violence
And the seal is the sworn enemy of man

Now when I say that the seal is vicious, I use the term advisedly
According to Webster's 9th New Collegiate, definition 4b
Which states that vicious means marked by ferocity
And offers as a synonym: savage

'Cause the seal is a vicious and a wily creature
And the seal has a mind full of evil designs
And the seal will harm you and laugh about it
Yeah the seal is not a creature you want to toy with
Yeah the seal is not a creature you want to toy with

Hauling peanut butter crank through Arizona
Gotta keep the glowstick babies fat and happy
Cactus standing taller than Goliath
All the vultures come directly at me

We stash it in between some bales of lumber
On flatbeds coming in from Colorado
I don't know what you're doing back in Memphis
All winter you've been incommunicado

Take a picture, do it fast
For the good times
For the good times
That won't last

Hot sun peels the paint down to the primer
Overheating engine spits and whines
Try to keep our minds on what we're doing
Try to keep the wheels between the lines

The feeling when the cop car flips its lights on
The near-electric tension crackling here inside the truck
The lack of any word from you in Memphis
The sounds of someone running out of luck

Take a picture, do it fast
For the good times
For the good times
That won't last

Beautiful Gas Mask

Come hard through the fog
Blindfolded and bound
Till we stand at the edge
Of a hole in the ground

We hold hands and we jump
And as we fall we sing
Paupers hammering the walls of the castle
Going to meet the king

Never sleep, remember to breathe deep
Never sleep, remember to breathe
Breathe deep

Crash in from deep space
Shot birds falling fast
Who will be there to catch us in his jaws
When we arrive alive at last?

I can't hear you in the dark
Wish I knew where you'd gone
Know you're there
off in the shadow somewhere
Try to soldier on

Never sleep, remember to breathe deep
Never sleep, remember to breathe
Breathe deep
And breathe humbly

Secure your mouthpiece when you can
Toxic shapes adorn the walls
As we rise from our knees
Someone's coming to reward us,
you wait and see
Or crush us both like fleas

Never sleep, remember to breathe deep
Never sleep, remember to breathe
Breathe deep

Before I Got There
============================================================
The acrid smell of burning branches
The relics all in ruin
Broken blades atop the altar
Cheap substitutions
And the tapestry above
Torn down, trampled, then re-hung
Now illegible forever
An oracle with no tongue

All of this
All of this
All of this before I got there

And in a pit behind the altar
The bodies of the fallen
Heavy tracks up to the lip
Just to prove that they were crawling
Faces turned toward the sky
That they would never see again
Victims of the fallout
I have failed you—sweet, young men

All of this
All of this
All of this before I got there

Toward the tail-end of the age that's almost finished
Where the highway starts to crack and nobody fixes it
I was wandering through an undeveloped tract
Out near the ocean
100 acres, we will build to suit
See what there is to see before it's gone
Somebody's always just about
To put some kind of awful plan in motion

Eastern redcedars, and the pines
And suddenly an elevated stone slab
In what must have been a clearing once
Try to recognize the signals and the signposts
My curiosity
Will likely always get the best of me

It's like that one thing
My Dad kept trying to tell me
As the twilight
Inched its way on up his body
Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out!

Well of course I climbed atop the slab and I lay down on it
I am a child
I had my face toward the sky lying there in the sun with both my eyes closed
Woke up in near darkness
What the hell is wrong with me
Volunteer pines in their hundreds in the dusk like military tentpoles

Let my eyes adjust
Try to read the markings on the slab
Weird alphabets I felt sure I hadn't seen just before I passed out
Stars growing brighter
Me looking up
Like a lobster in a cage down in the depths beneath the bottom of a glass boat

And I heard a voice
From somewhere out beyond the free fall
Like a captive soldier
Trying to warn his brothers
Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out!
============================================================
Beyond the Mysterious Beyond
============================================================
Beyond the Mysterious Beyond
Out past the smallest light that's twinkling
You cannot even have an inkling
Of what is going on

Beyond the Mysterious Beyond
Out where the darkness is the scariest
Out where the wonders are the rariest
Past the edge of dawn

There's so much more to everything
Than anyone supposes
The answers lay inside your dreams
And underneath your noses

Beyond the Mysterious Beyond
They act like they really think they know it all
But I won't believe it 'til they show it all
I trust what my eyes can see
Not some dumb beyond

Beyond the Mysterious Beyond
Think of the things that we could see there
Oh, how I wish that we could be there
All of my friends and me

If stars can fall and rocks can fly
And mountains catch on fire
We can set our sights beyond the stars
Maybe even higher
Beyond the Mysterious Beyond

The Mysterious Beyond
Trust in your own imagination
You are a part of the creation
Of all that lies beyond
The Mysterious Beyond

Big Ed takes the town by storm.
Long arm of the lot.
Gratitude suffers, people scream
when Big Ed stumbles in
grabbing girls and young men.
Big Ed is a crazy motherfucker.

Billy the Kid's Dream of the Magic Shoes

Hang me out to dry
They're gonna hang me out to dry
I don't really care

I got special shoes

They're gonna fill me full of holes
They're gonna fill me full of holes
I don't give a rat's ass

I got special shoes on

Bird on the Wire
============================================================
Like a bird on a wire
Like a drunk in some midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free

Like a worm on a hook
Like a knight bent now in some old-fashioned book
It was the shape of our love twisted me

If I have, if I have been unkind
I hope you can, I hope you can
Let it all go by, let it go by
And if I have, if I have been untrue
It's just that I thought a lover had to be some kind of liar too

Oh, like a baby, stillborn
Like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out to me

But I swear by this song
And by everything I have done wrong
I will make it all up to thee

Saw a beggar, he was leaning on his wooden crutch
He said to me "Come on now, you must not ask for so much"
And then another pretty woman, she was leaning in a door
She said to me "Come on pal, why don't you ask for just a little more?"

Like a bird on a wire
Like a drunk in some midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free

Birth of Serpents
============================================================
Let the camera pull back till the fullness
of the frame is clear and plain
Peer into the screen until you see it all
like a vision in a crystal ball
Let it all fill with smoke
Is this somebody's idea of a joke

Let the fixer work until the silver's
washed away and take the
picture from the tray
Look hard at what you see and then
remember you and me
and let the truth spring free

Like a jack-in-the-box
Like a hundred-thousand cuckoo clocks
From the Oregon corners
To the Iowa corn
To the rooms with the heat lamps
where the snakes get born

Crawl through the tunnel and follow,
follow the light northwest
See that young man who dwells inside
his body like an uninvited guest
See the tunnel twist
Clutch your birthright in your fist
Let the camera do its dirty work
down there in the dark
Sink low, rise high,
and bring back some blurry pictures to
remember all your darker moments by

Permanent bruises on our knees
Never forget what it felt like
to live in rooms like these
From the California coastline
To the Iowa corn
To the rooms with the heat lamps
where the snakes get born

Birthday Song: This Time Has Gone
============================================================
The sun came out this morning, I was wide awake
I stumbled on down to the kitchen and I cut myself a piece of my birthday cake
With raspberry filling in the middle
I thought about you a little
And there was a time when you wanted me so bad
It was eating you up inside
But this time has gone away

I poured myself a tall glass of milk, it was deep and cold
And I checked my driver's license, I was 28 years old
And there was a time when you wanted me so bad
It was eating you up inside
But this time has gone away
============================================================
Black Man Trapped
============================================================
I don't like it here.
Who's got moldy?
I got
HA HA
I got moldy.
Don't stop digging.
Something's wrong with the light.
============================================================
Black Molly
============================================================
Black mollies in the aquarium
Darting back and forth as though an earthquake were certain
And I turned up the heater
And I ripped off my shirt
And I grabbed hold of my stereo
And I threw it out the window
You were in town again
You'd come around again
You were dragging me down again
With you

Siamese fighting fish flashing like sparklers
It started to rain
And the telephone rang a couple of times
I put a bullet through its cold dead brain
And I got out my photographs of you
And I put bullets though all of them too
You were in town again
You'd come around again
You were dragging me down again
With you
============================================================
Black Pear Tree
============================================================
I dug a hole and filled it up with compost
Rested on the cool grass for a minute
I saw the future in a dream last night
There's nothing in it

I set the sapling in the hole
Started gently tamping down the dirt
I saw the future in a dream last night
Somebody's gonna get hurt, somebody's gonna get hurt
I hope it's not me
But I suspect it's going to have to be

I dug my heels in for the winter
And I waited for the snow
But something was stuck up in the clouds
Something was stuck up there
It couldn't let go

And when its time came I could see it happen
Blossoms black and sweet as Texas crude
I saw the future flowering like a ruptured vessel
Somebody's gonna get screwed
It won't be me
Someday I am going to walk out of here free
============================================================
Bleed Out (song)
============================================================
Every time they knock me down
I rise to my feet
Every time I take a bullet, they find a medic
To patch me up real neat
You only have to run the numbers to know
Sooner or later everybody's gotta go
Bleed out
I'm gonna bleed out

I'm gonna bleed out
I'm gonna bleed out
There won't be anybody waiting to rush me to safety
I'm gonna let the long night take me
Bleed out
I'm gonna bleed out

Every bender needs a blackout
Every gauge deserves a top line
Every story needs a child who believes
The brave hero's gonna be just fine
You only have to check the papers to see
Some of these children end up just like me
Bleed out
I'm gonna bleed out

I'm gonna bleed out
I'm gonna bleed out
I'm gonna make a gigantic mess
But it meant something important I guess
Bleed out
I'm gonna bleed out

Somewhere beyond imagination
Somewhere beneath the final delta
Washed up on the banks of a river at the height of the storm
Everybody seeking shelter
I'm gonna dive right in
I can't swim
Bleed out
I'm gonna bleed out

I'm gonna bleed out
I'm gonna bleed out
There's gonna be a big spot where I once lay
And there won't even be a spot one day
Bleed out
I'm gonna bleed out

There was a chance we'd make it through this
It's safe to say now that we missed it
And I will never lose hope, and I haven't lost hope
I'm just realistic
I will go down punching, but I will go down
And my corner man won't bring me back around
Bleed out
I'm gonna bleed out

The blood is pooling underneath me
Flowing freely from my mouth
You wanna call a medevac - now?
Knock yourself out
You can tell them when they get here
You tried
But the smallest hole was several inches wide
Bleed out
I'm gonna bleed out

I'm gonna head into the darkness
I'm gonna head into the light
I will surrender to the slow, lurching tide
Drift off into the night
There won't be any words of wisdom from me
Just a lake of blood for all the world to see
Bleed out
I'm gonna bleed out

I'm gonna bleed out
I'm gonna bleed out
I'm gonna tell my friends to all go to Hell
And wish my enemies well
Bleed out
I'm gonna bleed out

I'm gonna bleed out
I'm gonna bleed out
If it's blood you want, I've got plenty of it!
You're gonna love it!
Bleed out
I'm gonna bleed out

Blood Bank
============================================================
Well, I met you at the blood bank
We were looking at the bags
Wondering if any of the colors
Matched any of the names we knew from the tags
You said "See, look at that, that's yours
Stacked on top with your brother's
See how they resemble one another
Even in their plastic little covers?"

And I said I know it well
That secret that you know
But you don't know how to tell
It fucks with your honor
And it teases your head
But you know that it's good
Because it's running you with red

Then the snow started falling
We were stuck out in your car
You were rubbing both of my hands
Chewing on a candy bar
You said "Ain't this just like the present
To be showing up like this?"
As a moon waned to crescent
We started to kiss

And I said I know it well
That secret that we know
That we don't know how to tell
I'm in love with your honor
I'm in love with your cheeks
What's that noise up the stairs, babe?
Is that Christmas morning creaks?

I know it
And I know it
============================================================
Blood Capsules
============================================================
When the last of the East Coast money ran dry
And the casually-dressed bill collectors
Started casually dropping on by
And the residuals, but there weren't any more residuals
At least several months behind
On the payments to certain individuals

I strolled into the lobby
Mouth full
Blood capsules
I strolled into the lobby
Mouth full
Blood capsules

I'm off the juice for seven months
I learn to like living clean
But there just isn't any money
On the independent scene
Not even if you're cutting corners
Staying in nights, eating alone
Somebody's gotta pay the gas bill
It's not gonna go away on its own

I strolled into the lobby
Mouth full
Blood capsules
I strolled into the lobby
Mouth full
Blood capsules

I'm the biggest guy in the bank line
Everybody else looks tiny
I could almost smell the fear
On the lunch-hour car salesman behind me
I know this isn't gonna work
I guess I'll see it when I see it
I can't work any other jobs
This was my last and best idea

I strolled into the lobby
Mouth full
Blood capsules
I strolled into the lobby
Mouth full
Blood capsules
============================================================
Blood Royal
============================================================
I remembered you
I remembered where you'd come from
I remembered you
I remembered where you've gone

And in the shifting neon air
I saw the colors of the revolution everywhere
Blood royal

I remembered you
I remembered all the things you said
I remembered the shape of your face
I let the thought go to my head

And in the iron blue dawn
I felt power coming on
Blood royal
============================================================
Blueberry Frost
============================================================
When you saw the evening star
Shining in the freezing sky
I saw something dark and silent
Passing by

Full moon
Deep grass
Cold water

When you said your name out loud
Something broke inside me
Nothing new to take a hold of
No new world to hide me

Full moon
Deep grass
Cold water

Full moon
Deep grass
Cold water
============================================================
Bluejays and Cardinals
============================================================
Bluejays and cardinals all come out to play
The highway traffic gets out of your way
Skies clear up if they're overcast
Pit bulls are gentle when you come past
Stars come out of hiding for you
And I would too

But this world couldn't hold you
You slipped free
Yeah this world couldn't hold you
You slipped free
Without me

The new sheen all over everything
When you open up your mouth to sing
Baseballs travel further when you watch them fly
Apples fatten on the trees when you walk by
You bring something unreplaceable to each and every day
Or you used to anyway

But this world couldn't hold you
And you slipped free
Yeah this world couldn't hold you
You slipped free
Without me
============================================================
Blues in Dallas
============================================================
will I see you there when that final trumpet blows?
will I see you there when that final trumpet blows?
if I don't see you there, I will run a comb through my hair.
and I will wait.
I will wait.
I will wait.

will you walk on in when the angel summons you?
will you walk on in when the angel summons you?
if I don't see you go, I will let the minions flow.
and I will wait.
I will wait.
I will wait.

down in dealey plaza, the tourists mill about.
down in dealey plaza, the tourists mill about.
and I am far from where we live, and I have not learned how to forgive.
but I will wait.
I will wait.
I will wait.

Bones Don't Rust
============================================================
Never any call for a lone wolf
You have to learn to go with the flow
But they can find a use for a scarecrow
Depending on your stomach for crows
Always gonna need a little muscle
If you prove yourself worthy of trust
Your bones don't rust

Haven't checked a mirror in years
Don't need to know the bad news
There's not gonna be a gold watch
After thirty years of paying your dues
Show up five minutes early as usual
Work on just a couple hours' rest
Your bones don't rust

They stay hard as diamonds
They cut through steel
They still sing when they're hungry
And they ache when they're angry

Listen for the voice of the spirit
Maybe something wrong with your ears
Always on the edge of collapse now
Absolutely nobody cares
But everybody loves a professional
Not a single track in the dust
Your bones don't rust
============================================================
Born Ready
============================================================
I'm going to see you in San Jose
I'm going to see you in San Jose
And I'm going to take you out for good
I'm going to take you down

I'm headed up the 101 right now
I'm headed up the 101 right now
And there's snow on the ground in Ohio today
There's no snow here

And the sun is in my eyes
Yeah the sun is in my eyes
When I think about you, I feel so bad
It's been a long, long, long, long time
============================================================
Boxcar
============================================================
You're not punk, and I'm telling everyone
Save your breath, I never was one
You don't know what I'm all about
Like watching Cops and reading Didion
My enemies are all too familiar
They're the ones who used to call me friends
I'm coloring outside your guidelines
I was passing out while you were passing out your rules
One, two, three, four
Who's punk what's the score

Got a friend, her name is Boxcar
Like cigarettes and beer in El Sob
Her hair is blue, her eyes are green
I love her mind, she hates the scene
My enemies are all too familiar
They're the ones that used to call me friend
I'm coloring outside your guidelines
I was passing out while you were passing out your rules
One, two, three, four
Who's punk what's the score

You're on your own
You're all alone
You're on your own
You're all alone
You're on your own
You're all alone
You're on your own
You're all alone
============================================================
Brandy Let's Go
============================================================
You say I've forgotten what being young's all about
How could you say that to me
You say I don't know how to have fun anymore
Well that just may be
But it may be otherwise
Try me
And see if it isn't so
I got a handgun, and a bottle of brandy
Let's go

You try and trace Taurus in the sky for me
But I know you don't know what you're doing
But when I turn my face toward the cold, clean sidewalk
I can see the world glowing
You say I've forgotten what love's all about
You say I don't know how to shake the cobwebs out
I look into your eyes
And I see the fury grow
I got a handgun, and a bottle of brandy
Let's go
============================================================
Brave
============================================================
Color me red, color me coal
Wrap me in black or a snide acid green
Tell me I'm bad, tell me I'm sick
Scream out your hate, be obsessed and obscene
Bind me with love, tie me with wire
Wrap me in gauze and then watch as I bleed
Poison your kiss, kill my desire
Deliver me pain and ignore all my needs
I will not change, I will not alter

Staple my eyes, thrill to my shins
Gag me with lead and tear out all my nails
Razor my tongue, sew up my mouth
Feed me disease so my functioning fails
I will not change, I will not alter
For I am man and I am strong

Do all this to me, I just don't care
Blood is my wine and fear is my friend
But please do not say I am not hard
Don't say I can yield, don't say I can bend
I will not change, I will not alter
For I am man and I am strong
I cannot sway, I cannot falter
I must be Man, I can't be wrong

It's your fucking fault
You and your doubts
Made me like this
Colored me man, color me man
============================================================
Bride
============================================================
Designed for one another
We lie tied to our slabs
While the same electricity that gave us life
Crackles through the lab

And I am too dumb
To tell you how I feel
Who will know, who will tell anyone
That what we had was real

We belong dead
We belong dead

So I try and try to focus
To say what I want to say
But it's such hard work
And we don't have all day

Our efforts won't add up
To any great amount
Get one chance to make your gesture down here
I wanna make mine count

We belong dead
We belong dead
We belong dead
We belong dead
============================================================
Bridge of Sighs
============================================================
The sun don't shine
The moon won't move the tides to wash me clean

The sun don't shine
The moon won't move the tides to wash me clean

Why so unforgiving
And why so cold
Long time crossing the bridge of sighs

The cold wind blows
The Gods look down in anger on this poor child

The cold wind blows
The Gods look down in anger on this poor child

Why so unforgiving
Why so cold
Long time crossing the bridge of sighs

The cold wind blows
The Gods look down in anger on this poor child

The cold wind blows
The Gods look down in anger on this poor child

Why so unforgiving
Why so cold
Long time crossing the bridge of sighs

Brilliant Disguise
============================================================
i hold you in my arms as the band plays
what are those words whispered baby, just as you turned away?
i saw you last night out at the edge of town.
i want to read your mind just to know what i've got in this new thing i've found.
so tell me what i see when i look in your eyes.
is that you baby, or just a brilliant disguise?

i heard somebody call your name from underneath our willow.
i saw something tucked in shame underneath your pillow.
well i've tried so hard baby, but i just cannot see
what a woman like you could possibly want with a man like me.
so tell me what i see when i look in your eyes.
is it you baby, or just a brilliant disguise?

now you play the loving woman i'll play the faithful man.
but just don?t look too closely in the palm of my hand.
we stood at the altar the gypsy swore our future was bright.
but come the wee wee hours well maybe baby the gypsy lied.
so when you look at mei, well look hard and look twice.
is that me baby, or just a brilliant disguise?
============================================================
Bring Our Curses Home
============================================================
Stray shards of vinyl siding
Hit the windshield coming down
On the gridlocked freeway
Headed for Houston out of town

We were sad to see it sinking
Up on the Jumbotron
Balconies in higher places
Gone, gone, gone

Young Romans at the city wall
Scavenging for scraps
Riding out the amnesia
Filling in the gaps

Grab hold of my hammer
Try to bring down the Superdome
On that rainy day
When I bring my curses home

Water floods the pharmacy
People sliding down the aisle
Emerging into the moonlit night
All smiles, all smiles

Wished I was down there with them
Reaching for that third rail
Saw them on the TV though
As they herded them down to jail

That night someone brought some shoes in
From Los Angeles or Portland I forget
Mad scramble for the boxes
Everything got wet

Wingless, broken insects
Trapped in honeycomb
On that wasteful day
When I bring my curses home
============================================================
Brisbane Hotel Sutra
============================================================
On the crooked road that took me north
And brought me home again
From the pit of writhing serpents
Out to the lion's den
Where the labyrinth is lightless
And the faithless wander crazed
Let the light rise from the darkness
Let his name be praised

From the sunrise of my childhood
To its premature demise
From my mother's best intentions
To my stepdad's seething eyes
From the hidden self-inflicted wounds
That flowered in later days
To the folly of their learning
Let his name be praised

In the holes the worms have eaten
Through all once-treasured things
From the wet mouth of the vulture
To the red tips of his wings
In the dazed eyes of the penitent
Emerging from the maze
In his wordless explanations
Let his name be praised
============================================================
Broom People
============================================================
'36 hudson in the garage,
all sorts of junk in the unattached spare room,
dishes in the kitchen sink,
new straw for the old broom,
friends who dont have a clue,
well meaning teachers,
but down in your arms,
in your arms, I am a wild creature.

floor two foot high with newspapers,
white carpet thick with pet hair,
half eaten gallons of ice cream in the freezer,
fresh fuel for the sodium flares,
I write down good reasons to freeze to death
in my spiral ring notebook,
but in the long tresses of your hair
I am a babbling brook.
============================================================
Burned My Tongue
============================================================
Woke up this morning about a quarter to five
Said the prayer you'd taught me to keep myself alive
It burned my tongue
It burned my tongue

Fried some grains in butter, said a simple grace
Sat down at the table, fed my greedy face
It burned my tongue
It burned my tongue

Looked out at the ocean, I could see it so clear
Said the only name I can ever stand to hear
It burned my tongue
It burned my tongue

When I ask you to sing with me, I wish you'd sing along
Thirty years in this world, thirty years too long
It burns my tongue
It burns my tongue

You took away my friends, you took my will to live
I gave you all I got, what more've I got to give
It burns my tongue
It burns my tongue
It burns my tongue
It burns my tongue
============================================================
Butter Teeth
============================================================
We spilled out through the front door
Into the blinding late light
Sun reflected on the storefront windows
Tremendously bright

We were Norwegians come down from the north
Attacking the walls of the fortress
I was permanently at the point of exhaustion
You were gorgeous

Who's here—just us
Nobody else around
Stray electrical currents
Trying to find the ground

We haunted the walls of the pharmacy
Artlessly shoplifting random things
Painkillers, cough syrup, tiger balm
Bubblegum, cigarettes, and shower curtain rings

We were Portuguese warships cresting the waves
Cannons raised ready to dock
You were counting down the hours and the minutes
I was trying to find a way of stopping the clock

Who's here—just us
Nobody else around
Stray electrical currents
Trying to find the ground
============================================================
Cadaver Cake
============================================================
This cake's made out of human remains
The frosting is blood, the frosting is blood
This cake's made out of human remains
The frosting is blood, the frosting is blood

And though the first layer is spongy
The next layer is human bone
I know the first layer is spongy
Don't want to eat this cake alone

This cake's made out of human remains
The frosting is blood, the frosting is blood
This cake's made out of human remains
The frosting is blood, the frosting is blood

I must be one of the earth's walking damned
To be chosen to eat this awful cake
I must be some sort of sacrificial lamb
Because it will kill me to eat this cake

This cake's made out of human remains
The frosting is blood, the frosting is blood
This cake's made out of human remains
The frosting is blood, the frosting is blood
The frosting is blood, the frosting is blood
============================================================
Cadaver Sniffing Dog
============================================================
Hustle up the spiral stairs
See if anyone’s left up there
Teams on the scene from several stations
Everybody, adjust your expectations
Stray clumps of hair and blood and brain
Fragments of bone in the drain
Rookies trying to keep the airway clear
But the damage is too severe

Bring in the cadaver sniffing dog
Bring in the cadaver sniffing dog
Bring in the cadaver sniffing dog
Bring in the cadaver sniffing dog

Army crawlers down ash wet floor
Ready for war
Veterans on their hands and knees
Nobody's ready for days like these
Wait 'til you come up on the smoking wreck
And even then you check
Radio home all clean
If there were any survivors they've fled the scene

Bring in the cadaver sniffing dog
Bring in the cadaver sniffing dog
Bring in the cadaver sniffing dog
Bring in the cadaver sniffing dog
============================================================
Calcutta
============================================================
Wild donkeys kicking, braying in the meadow
Made you wanna kick and bray yourself, at least you said so
And you were wild eyed, your lips were flecked with foam
'Til warm Calcutta called you home

Twin rivers flowing brought a flush into your cheek
At the spot where the trickling streams and rivers meet
The wind from off the snowcapped mountain cooled you down
'Til warm Calcutta brought you back around

I could hear the prophets yelling in the street
How your eyes were pure poison, but your skin was sweet
============================================================
California Jam
============================================================
Helicopter in, from Los Angeles
Land in Ontario, guys with cameras
Hey you, can I get a quick interview
Beat-up stretch limousine to the speedway
In the baking sun, stay high all day
Take to the stage, lords of the age

Drums rolling like buffalo down the plain
And I am an oncoming train
Me and the ghosts of Birmingham
Me and the ghosts of Birmingham

Light rigging over, rainbow behind
And the cloudless sky, and the infinite distances in my mind
Arms in the air, sun in my hair
Rise like dancers, stick the landing
Feel kind of beautiful, everybody here is beautiful
That's just how I feel, and it's real

Drums rolling like buffalo down the plain
And I am an oncoming train
Me and the ghosts of Birmingham
Me and the ghosts of Birmingham
============================================================
California Song
============================================================
I know you see Mars in the sky tonight
I know you can see Venus rising and veering off to the right.
but can you see that young star overhead?
it's the one that designed my undoing.
I know that in California the waves break on the beach.
and I know that the foam on the breaking waves
is as white as household bleach.
but do you see that particular white right now
it's the color of the young star coming on down.
I got joy joy joy in my soul tonight
I got joy joy joy in my arms alright.
although you treat me badly,
I love you madly.
you really got a hold on me.
you really got a hold on me.

Calling Out Your Name
============================================================
Well the moon fell on Nebraska
And spilled laughter on them cold Dakota Hills
And angels danced on Jacob's stairs
Well, they danced on Jacob's stairs
There is this silence in the Badlands
And over Kansas the whole universe was stilled
By the whisper of a prayer
By the whisper of a prayer

And a single hawk bursts into flight
And in the east the whole horizon is in flame
I hear the thunder in the sky
I see the sky about to rain
And with the prairies I am calling out Your name

I can hear the earth trembling
Beneath the rumbling of the buffalo hooves
And the fury in the pheasant's wing
And there's fury in the pheasant's wing
And it tells me the Lord is in His temple
And there is still a faith that can make the mountains move
And a love that can make the heavens ring
Well I've seen love make heaven ring

Where the sacred rivers meet
Beneath the shadow of the Keeper of the plains
I hear the thunder in the sky
I see the sky about to rain
And with the prairie I am calling out Your name

From the place where morning gathers
You can look sometimes forever 'til you see
What time may never know
What time may never know
How the Lord takes by its corners this old world
And shakes us forward and shakes us free
To run wild with the hope
To run wild with the hope

The hope that this thirst will not last long
That it will soon drown in a song not sung in vain
I hear the thunder in the sky
I see the sky about to rain
And I hear the prairies calling out Your name

I hear the thunder in the sky
I see the sky about to rain
And with the prairies I am calling out Your name

Cao Dai Blowout
============================================================
He came knocking down the streetlights
Tearing up the new grass on the lawn
He was frightening all the livestock
I could feel him coming on
I lit the Citronella, it was all that I had
And I began to feel real bad

When the ghost of your father comes to town
What the hell else can you do
I flung open all the windows
Put the water on for tea
And let him pass right on through

And he took to knocking over furniture
Getting into the reception on the wireless
He tore up all the dry goods in the pantry
He was strong and he was tireless
And when the priest came to call, I sent him on his way
I got a tremor in my hand and my feet are made of clay

When the ghost of your father starts pushing you around
How are you gonna make him stop
I took down all the crosses
I let him set up shop

Carmen Cicero
============================================================
There's power in the name
But the name's been lost for centuries
There's poison in the water
But the water tastes like honey
And we're so thirsty we don't care where we wake up tomorrow
We don't care, the question can hardly hold our attention

And this is a song for your young men to sing when they run out of options
Yeah, when they run out of options

There's the faith you can give or withhold
And then there's the one true faith
There's the revolution you came for
And the one you're eventually going to get
And there's a road that starts right here and leads clear up to Saskatchewan
And I brought a full tank and a '67 Mustang

And this is a song for your young women to whistle
While they're driving at high speeds down the highway

There's wind up in the trees
There's a song on the wind
There's a message in the song
But the message is hopelessly complicated
And the words are written on water
And they disappear before you write them down
But I, I brought the Polaroid

And this is the song
And everyone's gotta sing along
But it hasn't got a chorus
God damn it all

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Hey hey, la la la la

The mailman brought the mail by
But the devil sent the rain
The mailman brought the mail by
But the devil sent the rain
And the rain tore through the streets
Tore down Los Flores Canyon again

If the leak was in the attic
Then we'd all be doomed for sure
If the leak was in the attic
Then we'd all be doomed for sure
There's a leak up in the attic
Honey, let's get out of here

Gotta keep moving, gotta keep moving
Blues falling down like hail
Gotta keep moving
Blues falling down like hail
The sunlight keeps to worrying me
There's a hellhound on my trail

Cathedral Song
============================================================
I saw you from the cathedral
You were watching me
And I saw from the cathedral
What I could be
So take my time
And take my lies

And I watched with a basic instinct
It's the same for you
You stand in
Got your hands all laced and
What would you make me do
So take my time
Yeah and take my lies
Take my time

Serious for the winter time
To wrench my soul
Whole cotton, whole cotton ears
But I know there must be
I know there must be
I know there must be a place to go

You saw me in the cathedral
Well I'm an ancient heart
But you saw me in the cathedral
Well here we are just falling apart
You catch me
I am tired
I want all that you are

And I saw from the cathedral
You were leaving me
Yeah I saw from the cathedral
You couldn't see the forest for the trees
So take my time
And take my lies
Take my time
Take my time
Take my time
Take my time
Take my time
Take my time

Catherine Antrim's Kid
============================================================
Brush all the dust of Kansas
off of my special shoes
when the coach lets us out
at the corner store
Mom was coughing like an old man,
shivering like a cold man

and I found some trouble to get into
and the admiration was mutual
split my winnings with mom 55/45
but it didn't keep her alive

I got lost out there in New Mexico
nothing to lose nowhere to go
I got lost
when my lucky stars crossed

that night I dreamt about Fort Stanton
though I didn't know
to call it that yet
and the night wrapped me up
in its long dark embrace
I had that same expression on
as that one picture of my face

which was all anyone would
ever know about me
after my visitors got done with me
I lay down singing on the porch
blood streaming from my mouth
sounded kind of like Paul Westerberg
but to tell you the truth

I got lost out there in New Mexico
nothing to lose nowhere to go
I got lost
when my lucky stars crossed
============================================================
Chanson du Bon Chose
============================================================
Saw the sycamore underneath the moon
I was waiting for something
And you were sleeping out there in the living room
And it was 5:16 A.M.
The air was sharp and cool
And I wondered where you buried our dark little jewel

And the heat rising in the room
I am digging graves
I am digging graves
And the water boiling on the stove
I am digging graves
I am digging graves

So I held you close to me
I saw the shadows start to gather outside beneath the sycamore tree
And something was changing
This was something here entirely new
Bursting into blossom inside of us both with the sun coming up
And me holding onto you

And your body breathing on mine
I am digging graves
I am digging graves
And your hands running through my hair
I am digging graves
I am digging graves

Charlie Brown

Fe-fe, fi-fi, fo-fo, fum
I smell smoke from the auditorium

Charlie Brown, Charlie Brown
Oh he's a clown, that Charlie Brown
He's gonna get caught
Just you wait and see
Why's everybody always pickin' on me

That's him on his knees
I know that's him
Yellin' 7 come 11
In the boys' gym

Charlie Brown, Charlie Brown
Oh he's a clown, that Charlie Brown
He's gonna get caught
Just you wait and see
Why's everybody always pickin' on me

Who's always writing on the wall
Who's always goofing in the hall
Who's always throwing spitballs
Guess who (who, me) yeah, you

He walks in the classroom, cool and slow
Who calls the English teacher, Daddy-O

Charlie Brown, Charlie Brown
Oh he's a clown, that Charlie Brown
He's gonna get caught
Just you wait and see
Why's everybody always pickin' on me

He walks in the classroom, cool and slow
Who calls the English teacher, Daddy-O

Cheshire County
============================================================
When the sun came up, I got up
'Cause you were saying my name backwards in your sleep again

The field outside was wet and green
And the most gorgeous cow I've ever seen
Was coming right at me, right at you

Her udder was fat with fresh milk
And her black and white coat was as smooth as silk
And in the waning of a long, long year
I felt the remnants of last night disappear
Disappear
Disappear
Disappear
Disappear
Disappear
Disappear
Disappear
============================================================
Chilean Fire Barrel
============================================================
Smell of sulfur, cloven hoof
Birds were gathering on the roof
Faint voices, scratching sounds
If this keeps up, I may never come down
By the time I snapped out of it, there was nothing left
By the time I snapped out of it, there was nothing left
By the time I snapped out of it, you were long gone
By the time I snapped out of it, you were long gone

Spinning numbers, shepherd songs
Birds singing all the time, all wrong
Aunt Margaret, Cotton-Eyed Joe
They swear they're my friends, but I don't think so

By the time I snapped out of it, there was nothing left
By the time I snapped out of it, there was nothing left
By the time I snapped out of it, you were long gone
By the time I snapped out of it, you were long gone

Chinese House Flowers
============================================================
Wax paper that I taped over the windows
Melted as quick as chocolate in the heat
It'll probably never come off now
The windows look like frosted glass if you see them from the street
And the dim light that filters through
Casts a new light on you
It makes me get all misty because I remember something
And then I see your shadow

And I, I wanna follow you all the way down this time
I wanna see what it is you're going down for
I, I want you more than I want anything
I want you the way you were

You were lying in the moonlight
Outside in the grass
When I heard an animal voice somewhere in the dark
And I saw a winged shadow pass
And just then the gleam in your eye
Made my blood freeze
There was something up above us
Rustling in the branches of the trees

And I, I pressed up against you again
I could hear your heartbeat
Steady and hard and pure
I used to love you so much that I was sure it would kill me
And I want you the way you were
============================================================
Chinese Rifle Song
============================================================
I lay out on the patio, dreaming
Lay out on the patio, dreaming
And the Chinese rifles sounded in the evening air
I heard them popping off everywhere

I lay out on the patio, on the chaise lounge
I lay out on the patio, and I let my hand rest against the hot redwood frame
And the Chinese rifles sounded again
I could not stomach their acumen
============================================================

Chino Love Song 1979
============================================================
And the May sun shone down on California
And the strawberries grew fat and full
And thick and red and as big as your fist
And the traffic on Riverside Drive was thin
But by no means non-existent

When I saw you against the soda machine
I saw you leaning there

And your hand in the basket
Was nimble-fingered, and red finger-nailed
And it made me remember the sunflower that popped up outside my window one
Morning in Norwalk
It was bright yellow and it was real inviting
And I almost forgot that it was an intruder

And I saw you against the soda machine
I saw you leaning there
I saw you against the soda machine
I saw you leaning there
============================================================
Choked Out
============================================================
Diamonds in the firmament
All reserves completely spent
Someone set up the oxygen tent
Everybody here's real proud to present
Choked out

Two hundred dollar take-all purse
Half-nelson to suplex reverse
Worried look on the face of the ringside nurse
At one, for once, with the universe
Choked out
Choked out, choked out, choked out

I stretch and strain with all my might
Drift off into the velvety arms of the night
Kick and claw and scratch and bite
Fire up the grill, everybody eats tonight
Choked out

No brakes down
An endless dark incline
Most of the boys
Won't ever cross this line
If they all want to die dead broke that's fine, that's fine
Everybody's got their limits
Nobody's found mine

Crowd screaming like hounds at the heat of the chase
All the colors of the rainbow flood my face
I lift right off into space
I can see the future, it's a real dark place
Choked out, choked out, choked out
Choked out, choked out, choked out
============================================================
Christmas in Prison
============================================================
It was Christmas in prison and the food was real good
We had turkey and pistols made out of wood
And I dream of her always even when I don't dream
And her name's on my tongue and her blood's in my stream

Wait a while, eternity
Old mother nature's got nothing on me
Come to me, run to me, come to me now
We're rolling by Jesus
We're rolling right now

She reminds me of a chess game with someone I admire
Or a picnic in the rain after a prairie fire
Her heart is as big as this whole goddamn jail
And she's sweeter than saccharine at a grocery store sale

Wait a while, eternity
Old mother nature's got nothing on me
Come to me, run to me, come to me now
We're rolling by Jesus
We're rolling right now

Well the searchlight in the big yard swings round with the gun
And the spot lights snowflakes like the dust in the sun
And It's Christmas in prison, there'll be red and green lights
And I'll probably get homesick, I love you, goodnight

Wait a while, eternity
Old mother nature's got nothing on me
Come to me, run to me, come to me now
We're rolling by Jesus
We're flowing by God
============================================================
Civilian
============================================================
I am nothing without pretend
I know my faults, can live with them
I am nothing without a man
I know my thoughts but I can hide them

I still keep my baby teeth
On the bedside table with my jewelry
You sleep in the bed with me
My jewelry, and my baby teeth

I don't need another friend
When most of them I can barely keep up with them
I'm perfectly able to hold my own hand
But I still can't kiss my own neck

I wanted to give you everything
But I still stand in awe of superficial things
I wanted to love you like my mother's mother's mother did
Civilian
Civilian

Clean Slate
============================================================
One from East St. Louis with a scar beneath his eye
Left the kitchen spotless on the day he said goodbye
Breakaway republic dude, supremely filthy mouth
Copiah, Mississippi; points much further south

It's never light outside yet when they climb into the van
Remember at your peril, forget the ones you can

Leave home feeling empty, change planes in Taipei
Stay awake the whole time, end up several worlds away
The house was almost full that day, they made a space for you
This world is sad and broken, gotta fix a crack or two

Rest until you're rested, climb back onto the caravan
Remember at your peril, forget the ones you can

And then just when you think you've learned how to forget
You learn it's just the ones who haven't risen to the surface yet

Absence after absence, keep the place secure
This will be the last time that I do this, I'm pretty sure
No one lasts for long in this profession, so they say
Maybe see you again someday

Every endpoint fixed forever on the day its arc began
Remember at your peril, forget the ones you can
Forget the ones you can
============================================================
Cleaning Crew
============================================================
You were passed out on the sofa
Cigarette burns and coffee stains
Loose change in your pocket
Naltrexone in your veins

They got a scanner at the airport now
And a dropout in a Kevlar vest
I can hear the timer
Ticking in my chest

What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do when the cleaning crew
comes through?

When you get out on your own again
If you ever do shake free
If you find yourself in Portland
Ask about me

Dig up the first revision
The one who's got less to lose
Look on every lamppost
From here to Baton Rouge

Ask yourself one question
Then ask yourself again

What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do when the cleaning crew
comes through?

It's better if you have a plan
It's better if you have a plan

I saw the future in an oil slick
It told me what I needed to know
Leave a little stain behind you everywhere you go

Clemency for the Wizard King
============================================================
We who train in the way of the blade
We who sleep in the accursed glade
We come before you now
We come before you now

We who in his favor would stand
Who lovingly await his most fearsome command
We come before you now
We come before you now

Cut loose the handcuffs
Let him go free

We who travel by starlight
We who slipped past your guards in the night
We come before you now
We come before you now

We who boldly lay claim to our own
We who have seen the chamber of the one true throne
We who have seen the kindness of the cracks of his face
We who will die if we must in this place

We come before you
Outnumbered and unafraid
Well-trained in the way of the blade

Cut loose the handcuffs
Let him go free (let him go free, let him go free, let him go free)

Cobra Tattoo
============================================================
Sun just clearing the tree line when my day begins
Slippery ice on the bridges, northeastern wind coming in
You will bruise my head, I will strike your heel
Drive past woods of northern pine, try not to let go of the wheel

Dream at night, girl with the cobra tattoo
On her arm, its head flaring out like a parachute

Prisms in the dewdrops in the underbrush
skate case sailors' purses floating down in the black needlerush
Higher than the stars I will set my throne
God does not need Abraham, God can raise children from stones

Dream at night, girl with the cobra tattoo
And try to hear the garbled transmissions coming through
============================================================
Cobscook Bay
============================================================
We're alone most of the time these days
Jill used to come by but she went away
And Gail used to come around and trash the joint
But she moved off to Dana Point
And you went along just for the ride
And you both committed suicide
And day is breaking over Cobscook Bay
And I've never seen anything like it in my life

Cow gave birth and her calves are snow white
They huddle up close together at night
And the mamma cow leans down and cleans her young
Licking their faces with her tongue
And unmarked airplanes buzz the air
And you're falling off that cliff somewhere in California
Which I've never seen
I put the pieces all together, but I don't know what they mean
And day is breaking over Cobscook Bay
And I've never seen anything like it in my life
============================================================
Coco-Yam Song
============================================================
A neighboring clan went on the attack
Stole all the giant coco-yams
From the barn out back
I will make them pay
For taking my yams away

I carved out little figurines of thieves
Burned a palmful of red dust from the medicine bag
Broke a kola nut in half, I ate half of it myself
I sat back and watched the evening drag
I will make them regret
That they haven't brought my yams back yet
============================================================
Coffee
============================================================
We don't need no walkie-talkies, nope no walkie talkies
We don't need your coughing when offing the morning coffee
No, we don't need no walkie-talkies, nope no walkie-talkies
We just want our hermitry to stay and our coffee to go

And the last shall be
First to immerse in the pass out heat
Face in the mud where the moxie melt
'Till he woke up drowning in tchotchke hell
More in a cave with a torch on the wall
Than a window arrangement of porcelain dolls
On a brand new day, saw what he saw
Property owners who crawl to the mall
With a bad toupee and a face like he author the law
Pace like he mourning a loss
Right hand on a can of worms
Left full of gold he will trade for turf, I mean
That's ok, you got to answer to you at the end of the volatile day
But a model of mercy and might, no way
Marionette who will clap and obey
Dude, look, all that noise
Call that flight of the water boys
Meet and greet and they all slap five
Cheek to cheek when they colonize
And a grown-ass man shall abide as he wish
Walk that path with a dime and a stick
Walk that path with a diamond and wine
Walk that path to the firing line
Just walk, pay no mind
To the new recruit with the play-doh spine
Let's be friends from opposite ends
Wave to the kid don't hop on the fence
Play to the radius far and away
Orbit wide don't park in his space
One little martyr who talk in his face
Make one little Weathermen sharpen the blades

We don't need no walkie-talkies, nope no walkie talkies
We don't need your coughing when offing the morning coffee
No, we don't need no walkie-talkies, nope no walkie-talkies
We just want our hermitry to stay and our coffee to go

And the last shall be
First to the curb with the mad cow meat
Face in the bars of a regular cell
When he woke up high in collectible hell
Boom town kid who was taught by the binge
That a man who expire with the most shit win
That's warpy american nonsense penned by the rich
Not a routine friend in a pinch
Still not used to the stench
How it throws off otherwise lucid events
In the case the afraid observe
I got a Pro-Keds box full of layman's terms, it goes
Hey, peace, pray for the plagued
Major relief and capacious rains
But just cuz I don't want to war with you
It don't mean go warm up the barbecue
I'm like pardon you, sawed off limit
My high noon is a quick little minute
I don't wanna spend it sitting with a critic
Who simply isn't going to ever really get it
This HQ is alive and alone
No driveway no sign of a home
No dial tone, no line for the phone
No world's tiniest violin song
And I might just lie to them all, lie in the morgue
With a deep breath hiding and bored
Fighting a smile, highly annoyed
When the timing is right I will rise and record
Call for the monster beats and Blockhead got
Animal drums like he's doctor teeth
It goes red light green light 1 2 3
One large coffee, fuck you, peace

[John Darnielle
I crawled down to the basement
When the weather got cold
Like a lost lamb returning to the fold
And when the outside world recedes from view
It's just a year's supply of make-up
And memories of you
1967 Colt 45, holding back the vampires
Keeping me alive
There's an envelope with some cash in it
Out by the front door
This is what they make you take the medication for
============================================================
Cold Milk Bottle
============================================================
Rainbows shone on the glass
Dewdrops gathered on the grass
And the yellow sun came into view
Another goddamn message from you

Well despite your best efforts I feel alright
Against my better judgement I feel alright
Despite your random acts of violence I feel alright
Despite the force of your fury I feel alright

You're mean to me
Why must you be mean to me
You shouldn't forget, you see
What you mean to me
============================================================
Cold at Night
============================================================
Let yourself go in the current
Only rise and fall as the angles allow
Finally make a break for the surface
Breathe in the sweet air of the here and now

Wake up in the arms of the earth
Fully present at the second birth

The first thing you learn is how strong you can be if you have to
And the next thing you learn is how cold it can get at night

Let the waves break where they have to break
Let the people make ready to approach the throne
Two are going to stumble along the way
One is going to go up alone
Fires gathering on a distant peak
Let me get some sleep before I speak

The first thing you learn is how far you can go with no gas in the tank
And the next thing you learn is how cold it can get at night

Lightly row, but this much I know:
The first thing you learn will be the first thing to go

Sharpen sticks and stab at the tide pools
Pitch a camp as close as we can to shore
Nobody thought to carry a compass
It's not the 19th century any more

On the third day you said you felt sick
I could hear the clock tick

The first thing you learn is there's always a clock ticking somewhere
And the next thing you learn is how cold it can get at night
The first thing you learn is how strong you can be if you have to, so strong
(And the next thing you learn is how cold it can get at night)
And the next thing you learn is how cold it can get at night
(And the next thing you learn is how cold it can get at night)
And the next thing you learn is how cold it can get at night

Collapsing Stars
============================================================
When we hid out behind the risers at the high school
Working bitter calculations with a slide rule
The grim particulars of poisoning the swimming pool
Well, you looked me in the eye
Ready to die

We were becoming what we are
Collapsing stars

When we chewed up pseudoephedrine like bubblegum
'Til our hearts were beating as deep and rich as kettle drums
We knew if we waited long enough the change would come
And then the day did come, and at last
Hold tight
Hold fast

Catch lightning in a jar
Collapsing stars

I told you to load up on provisions
'Cause we wouldn't be back for a while
Load up your troubles in your old kit bag
Turn toward the camera and smile, smile, smile

When we ditched the plan to poison all our enemies
Tucked our weapons in a clearing, and covered them with leaves
We are gonna come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves
One day
And we are on our way

You can look
but you won't find
Another love like ours
collapsing stars

he drove from in from Mexicali, no worse for wear.
money to burn, time to kill.
but five minutes looking in his eyes and we all knew he
was broken pretty bad, so we gave him what we had.
we cleared a space for him to sleep in,
and we let the silence that's our trademark
make its presence felt.
come on in, we haven't slept for weeks.

they came in by the dozens, walking or crawling.
some were bright-eyed.
some were dead on their feet.
and they came from Zimbabwe,
or from Soviet Georgia.
east Saint Louis, or from Paris, or they lived across the street.
but they came, and when they'd finally made it here,
it was the least that we could do to make our welcome clear.

I'm still cruisin' all night

I'm gonna drink more whiskey than Brendan Behan
And I'm gonna send my belongings all to Tripoli
And I'm gonna ride home to California
With a banjo on my knee

I'm never gonna turn off the television
I'm just gonna let it run all night
I'm gonna plant root vegetables out in the backyard
And come summer I am going to treat you right

So put on your Chairman Mao coat
And let me clear my throat
Let's turn this whole town upside-down
And shake it 'til the coins come falling out of its pocket
Yeah put on your Che Guevara pin
Call the troops on in
We're gonna sail through the night sky like a pair of bottle rockets

I got a great big secret written down somewhere
I got a rosary to protect us both from harm
I got a storage locker full of cow figurines
And a laundry list of grievances longer than my arm
And I am never going back to Cincinnati
All those bridges have burned down to the ground
I got the jet pack strapped to my back
And I'm waiting for you to come around

Yeah, put on your Chairman Mao coat
And let me clear my throat
Let's turn this whole place upside-down, yes
And shake it 'til the coins come falling out of its pockets
Yeah put on your Che Guevara pin
Call the troops on in
We're gonna sail through the night sky like a pair of bottle rockets

Communicating Doors
============================================================
Campaign down from Atlanta
Five-hour drive to the coast
Brought whatever we thought we'd need
To pierce the skin of a ghost
Met your car at the hotel
Rode up seventeen floors
And checked ourselves into separate rooms with
Communicating doors

Lay on top of the covers
Turn the fan up to full
Chase a memory around my head
Silver, satin, and wool
Close the bar at the harbor
Say goodnight in the hall
Smash the lock with a midnight knock and
The rest I don't recall

Stones rise out of the water
Water eats at the stones
I know people who dig up graves
Just to label the bones
All that poison we swallowed
Seeping out through the pores
And floating over the transoms of
Communicating doors
============================================================
Corsican Mastiff Stride
============================================================
We sail we sleep we scry by land
We dig a pit beneath the sand
A place to keep the sun at bay
At dark we rise and find our way

With our faithful companion by our side
Put it all on the table and let it ride
Close to the dropoff on our long slide

The land we left becomes a dream
The ghosts we knew, they rise like steam
They leave some trails against the sky
All but invisible to the eye

With our faithful companion by our side
Put it all on the table and let it ride
Close to the dropoff on our long slide

Call off the search party,
Let mourners wail by the shore
Point to the spot where our ship disappeared
We're not coming home any more

Should you succeed and breach the coast
You tell your friends you've seen a ghost
You tell them all there's nothing here worth dying for
You leave it there

With our faithful companion by our side
Put it all on the table and let it ride
Close to the dropoff on our long slide

This song is for the rats
Who hurled themselves into the ocean
When they saw that the explosives in the cargo hold
Were just about to blow

This song is for the soil
That's toxic clear down to the bedrock
Where no thing of consequence can grow
Drop your seeds there
Let them go

Let them all go
Let 'em all go

This song is for the people
Who tell their families that they're sorry
For things they can't and won't feel sorry for

And once there was a desk
And now it's in a storage locker somewhere
And this song is for the stick pins and the cottons
I left in the top drawer

Let 'em all go
Let 'em all go

I wanna sing one for the cars
That are right now headed silent down the highway
And it's dark and there is nobody driving
And something has got to give

I saw you waiting by the roadside
You didn't know that I was watching
Now you know
Let it all go

Let 'em all go
Let it all go
============================================================
Counterfeit Florida Plates
============================================================
Steal some sunscreen
From the CVS
Use too much
And make a great big mess
Wait where shadows mask or hide my scent
So many so-called friends
Working for the government

Dig through the trash
Sleep on the grates
And watch for the cars
With the counterfeit Florida plates

Scribble cyphers on the library bathroom wall
Map a path from here to home
Can't quite catch em all
Calculate magnetic north
And turn the other way
Wait for the coming disaster
I could do this all day

Dig through the trash
Sleep on the grates
And watch for the cars
With the counterfeit Florida plates

It seems like everyone's cut me free
And left me to the tender cares of my faceless enemy

Feel so hungry
Probably pass out soon
Look for a tree to lean up against
Whistle a tune-less tune
This may be the night my point-men finally come
Wait for the fog to catch up with me
So I can at least feel numb

Dig through the trash
Sleep on the grates
And watch for the cars
With the counterfeit Florida plates
With the counterfeit Florida plates
With the counterfeit Florida plates

Counting Song for Bitter Children
============================================================
One, two, I don't love you
Three, four, any more
One, three, stay away from me
Five, seven, good children get nothing

Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na

One, two, two-and-a-half, stick around here, don't make me laugh
Two-and-a-half, three, four-point-five, the new day's dawning and my hour's arrived
One, two, I got things to do
One, three, I got people to see, I got people that want to see me

Na na na na na na na na

Cram This Truth, Dog

Someone reached inside my gut and pulled.
This is not my pain.
It bores me endlessly.
Someone put excitement in my life.
Crack through plain white walls.
Cram this truth, dog.

Crane
============================================================
Picked up a fat gold watch for you
Down where the river washes over the avenue
And I listened to it tick away the minutes
Looked out at the awful sky

I was afraid that my arm was broken
But it was only kinda run down
I went walking after two last night
Felt like I was the only guy in town
And I'm not, I know
And I don't need you to tell me so
Look at this watch, look at this watch
You won't believe what this thing can do
============================================================
Crazy On You
============================================================
If we still have time, we might still get by
Every time I think about it, I want to cry
With bombs and the devil, and the kids keep comin'
No way to breathe easy, no time to be young
============================================================
Crazy Train
============================================================
Crazy, but that's how it goes
Millions of people living as foes
Maybe it's not too late
To learn how to love and forget how to hate

Mental wounds not healing
Who and what's to blame
I'm heading off the rails on a crazy train
I'm heading off the rails on a crazy train

I've listened to preachers
I've listened to fools
I've watched all the dropouts
Who make their own rules
One person conditioned to rule and control
The media sells it and you live the role

Mental wounds still screaming
Driving me insane
I'm heading off the rails on a crazy train
I'm heading off the rails on a crazy train

I know that things are going wrong for me
You gotta listen to my words, yeah

Heirs of a cold war, that's what we've become
Inheriting troubles, I'm mentally numb
Crazy, I just cannot bear
I'm living with something that just isn't fair

Mental wounds still screaming
Life's a bitter shame
I'm heading off the rails on a crazy train
I'm heading off the rails on a crazy train
============================================================
Creature Song
============================================================
I remember the sound of your voice
But none of what you said
I remember the burning in my body
And the buzzing in my head
And I do remember your voice
Smoothing over my only choice
Oh, brave new world
That has such people in it
Oh, brave new world
That has such people in it

I can see the look on your face now
Yes I can
Bright light dancing all along your eyes
And you covering your mouth up with your hand
Your bracelets jangled against your arm
No harm intended, no harm
Oh, brave new world
That has such people in it
Oh, brave new world
Brave
============================================================
Crows
============================================================
Well I went way out North Carolina Way
To that old graveyard where my great grandmother lay
And the day was bright and I hadn't slept all night
And they'd sold the place to some guys who were building graduate student housing

No one had raised any objections
They were knocking the headstones down
And the sun was high when I rolled into town
Stood by a nameless hole in the ground
The air was sweet and hot
Maybe it was the right grave
Maybe not
But the crows, crows, crows
Rose, rose, rose from the grave
Yeah the crows crows crows
Rose, rose, rose from the grave
============================================================
Cruiserweights
============================================================
No one of any note is in the crowd
Guys in Bermuda shirts are chewing on cigar stubs
I get better as I get more worn down
Houselights like an amplified inferno
PA system borrowed from the high school
Breathe through my mouthpiece
I hate this town

And there's a whole long list of other things I hate
I had to starve myself all week to make weight
Cleveland, Ohio
1985
Almost out of the woods
Awake and alive

Bucket full of blood and dirty water
Voices screaming at me from my corner
Head for the clutches
When I need to buy time
Take a couple of shots right to the liver
Then remember what the food was like in prison
Stick to the game plan
Stall for time

And there's a whole long list of other things to do
And the best ones I won't probably get around to
Cleveland, Ohio
1985
Almost out of the woods
Awake and alive
============================================================
Cry for Judas
============================================================
Some things you do just to see
How bad they'll make you feel
Sometimes you try to freeze time
'Til those thoughts are a blur of spinning wheels
But I am just a broken machine
And I do things that I don't really mean

Long black night, morning frost
I'm still here, but all is lost

Speed up to the precipice
And then slam on the brakes
Some people crash two or three times
And then learn from their mistakes
But we are the ones who don't slow down at all
And there's nobody there to catch us when we fall

Long black night, morning frost
I'm still here, but all is lost

Feel the storm every night, hope it passes by
Hallucinate a shady grove where Judas went to die

Unfurl the black velvet altar cloth
Draw a white chalk baphomet
Mistreat your altar boys long enough
And this is what you get
Sad and angry, can't learn how to behave
Still won't know how in the darkness of the grave

Long black night, morning frost
I'm still here, but all is lost
============================================================
Cubs in Five
============================================================
They're gonna find intelligent life up there on the moon
And the Canterbury Tales will shoot up to the top of the bestseller list
And stay there for 27 weeks

And the Chicago Cubs will beat every team in the league
And the Tampa Bay Bucs will make it all the way through January
And I will love you again
I will love you, like I used to
I will love you again
I will love you, like I used to

The stars are gonna spell out the answers to tomorrow's crosswords
And the Phillips Corporation will admit that they've made an awful mistake
And Bill Gates will single-handedly spearhead
The Heaven 17 revival

And the Chicago Cubs will beat every team in the league
And the Tampa Bay Bucs will take it all the way to the top
And I will love you again
I will love you, like I used to
And I will love you again
I will love you, like I used to

Cut Off Their Thumbs Number 1
============================================================
We sprawl out on the bed or we lean against the wall
Down among the dregs out where the yellow spiders crawl
The telephone is broken and the drapes have all been closed
Hands up, who doesn't know exactly where this story goes

I'm gonna kill everybody in this room
I'm gonna kill everybody in this room

How has it come to this, well I haven't got a clue
You looking up at me and us two glowering down at you
Wind shakes the palm trees with an escalating fury
Face the judge or take your chances with the jury

I'm gonna kill everybody in this room
I'm gonna kill everybody in this room

Let's have a little music on this hazy afternoon
Let's hope the tension in here finds its resolution soon
Radio on the windowsill, old white moon above
God watches over children and he cares for fools in love

I'm gonna kill everybody in this room
I'm gonna kill everybody in this room
============================================================
Cut Your Hair
============================================================
Darlin' don't you go and cut your hair
Do you think it's gonna make him change
I'm just a girl with a new haircut
And that's a pretty nice haircut
Fix it like a puzzle
Hitmen wearin' muzzles
Hesitate, you die
Look around, around
The second drummer drowned
His telephone is found

Sing: Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Again: Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Music scene's crazy, bands start up
Each and everyday
I saw another one just the other day
A special new band
I don't remember lying
I don't remember line
Can't remember a word
I don't care, I care
I really don't care
Did you see the drummer's hair, hey

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

Advertising looks and chops a must
No big hair
March right down to the practice rooms
Career, career, career, career
Korea, Korea, Korea, Korea

Cutter
============================================================
I've been living hand-to-mouth for a year or better
When the mailman comes and he gives me your letter
And I recognize the handwriting even now
But I go ahead and open it anyhow, yeah
No one's been buying from my roadside stand and I
Hold your letter like a cross in my hand
I'm gonna wrap up my troubles
I'm gonna wrap up my troubles
I am gonna wrap up my troubles
In you

I went out into the kitchen
Where the light comes through the four-paneled window
Clean and bright
And it's taken me this long to realize
How much I like the way that you dot your "i"s
I was born in Indiana thirty years ago
I got a mean, cruel hunger down below
And I'm gonna wrap up my troubles
I am gonna wrap up my troubles
I'm gonna wrap up all my troubles
In you
============================================================
Damn These Vampires
============================================================
Brave young cowboys
Of the near north side
Mount those bridge rails
Ride all night

Scream when captured
Arch your back
Let this whole town hear
your knuckles crack

Sapphire Trans-Am
High beams in vain
Drive wild broncos
Down the plain

Push up to the corner
Where the turbines hiss
Someday we won't remember this

Crawl 'til dawn
On my hands and knees
God damn these vampires
For what they've done to me

Tie those horses
To the post outside
And let those glass doors
Open wide

And in their surface
See two young, savage things
Barely worth remembering

Feast like pagans
Never get enough
Sleep like dead men
Wake up like dead men

And when the sun comes
Try not to hate the light
Someday we'll try to walk upright

Crawl 'til dawn
On my hands and knees
God damn these bite marks
Deep in my arteries

Crawl 'til dawn
On my hands and knees
God damn these vampires
For what they've done to me
============================================================
Dance Music
============================================================
Alright I'm on Johnson Avenue
In San Luis Obispo
And I'm five years old or six maybe
And indications that there's something wrong with our new house
Trip down the wire twice daily

I'm in the living room watching the Watergate hearings
While my stepfather yells at my mother
Launches a glass across the room straight at her head
And I dash upstairs to take cover
Lean in close to my little record player on the floor
So this is what the volume knob's for
I listen to dance music
Dance music

Okay so I'm seventeen years old
And you're the last best thing I got going
But then the special secret sickness starts to eat through you
What am I supposed to do? No way of knowing

So I follow you down your twisting alleyways
Find a few cul-de-sacs of my own
There's only one place this road ever ends up
And I don't wanna die alone
Let me down, let me down, let me down gently
When the police come to get me
I'm listening to dance music
Dance music
============================================================
Daniel 12:8 (third)
============================================================
Walk in the darkness, bump into things all night
Get dizzy and angry searching for some source of light
Unknown alphabets in spray paint on the street
Seek out their source and find it and fall down at his feet

Get some aspirin powders to rub into my gums
Wait for the pain to hit me, buckle when it comes
Feel it drill in like a corkscrew
Avert my eyes when the cause comes into view

Feel the fear in my chest all day
Praise you anyway
Feel the fear in my chest all day
Praise you anyway

See the road rise to the summit up ahead
Remember an old friend with a pistol to his head
When it comes my time for the laying on of hands
Let me feel the blow when it lands

Look for the secrets half-buried like trinkets in a field
Hope that the hidden things someday will be revealed
Stumble through the darkness, can't see anything at all
Whimper like a whipped dog when I fall

Feel the fear in my chest all day
Praise you anyway
Feel the fear in my chest all day
Praise you anyway

Danny Says
============================================================
Danny says we gotta go
Gotta go to Idaho
But we can't go surfin 'cause it's 20 below
Soundcheck's at 5:02
Record stores and interviews
Oh, but I can't wait
To be with you tomorrow, baby

Oh oh oh, we got nowhere to go
And it might sound funny, but it's true
Hanging out in 100B
Watching Get Smart on TV
Thinking about you and me
And you and me

Hanging out in L.A. and there's nowhere to go
It ain't Christmas if there ain't no snow
Listening to Sheena on the radio
Oh-oh oh-oh-oh
Hanging out in 100B
Watching Get Smart on TV
Thinking about you and me
And you and me, baby

Oh oh oh, we got nowhere to go
And it might sound funny, but it's true
Hanging out in 100B
Watching Get Smart on TV
Thinking about you and me
And you and me
Oh-oh oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh oh-oh-oh

Dark as a Dungeon
============================================================
Come and listen you fellers, so young and so fine
And seek not your fortune way down in the mine
It will form as a habit and seep in your soul
'Til the stream of your blood is as black as the coal

Well, it's dark as a dungeon and damp as the dew
Where the dangers are doubled and the pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls and the sun doesn't shine
It's as dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

It's many a man I have known in my day
Who lived but to labor his whole life away
Like a fiend with his dope, or a drunkard his wine
A man must have lust for the lure of the mine

Well, it's dark as a dungeon and damp as the dew
Where the dangers are doubled and the pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls and the sun doesn't shine
It's as dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

The morning, the evening, the middle of day
They're the same to the miner who labors away
And the one who's not careful will never survive
One fall of the slate and you're buried alive

Well, it's dark as a dungeon and damp as the dew
Where the dangers are doubled and the pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls and the sun doesn't shine
It's as dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

I hope when I die and the ages will roll
My body will blacken and turn into coal
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home
And pity the miner that's digging my bones

Well, it's dark as a dungeon and damp as the dew
Where the dangers are doubled and the pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls and the sun doesn't shine
It's as dark as a dungeon way down in the mine
It's as dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

Dark in Here (song)
============================================================
Steal away at sundown, pick a place to hide
Check for signs of ambush, hunker down inside
Tired of running, tired of never standing still
Hear them riding up the hill

Men whose ribs are showing through their skin, bringing up the rear
It’s high noon somewhere, it’s dark in here

Stack my ammunition, be ready when you come
You who thirst for action, I will give you some
When the smoke dies down, you can rest assured
We will know who kept his word

You who stood so proud once, I can taste your fear
You blazed like torches, it’s dark in here

It’s dark as a coal mine filling up with gas
I stand ready for the blast

Will you be ready when your moment comes?
Will your hands be steady when you reach down for your guns?
Did you leave your house in order when you came for me?
Is this really where you meant to be?

Just beyond your limits, find the new frontier
I live in the darkness, it’s dark in here
============================================================
Deianara Crush
============================================================
One day in September you come here
You pull my head down and you whisper in my ear
And you tell me the sidewalk is as far as the world really goes
But that's a secret everybody knows

You hold my head in your hands, you say my name
How is it that though you say it some twenty thousand times, it's never quite the same
And you tell me that Hercules died burning, consumed by an article of his own clothing
That's something I'd rather not be reminded of
============================================================
Delilah Statuesque
============================================================
I took the coat of many colors on myself and it suits me well
Woven from your hair as I have watched it changing [in and over me
I feel it changing me and a billion bells ring out like constellations
When the devil’s many colored rags worked their black [faith through me
I will stand here for you because you said you like me this way
I hope you lied I think you lied I know you lied
All the grass gone yellow and the world turned wrong
I can feel my beating heart begin its meltdown into the new way
The house evolved everything dissolved
They told me this was going to happen, they told me this was going to happen
============================================================
Deserters
============================================================
The neighbors are cloning themselves
We found their cocoons in the garbage
We'll either stay high forever, or crash in an hour or two
Sleeping the sleep of the blessed
Picking through trashcans with you

The guy on TV is a prophet
You just have to look in his eyes
And we'll either turn our lives over to Christ or we'll just drift off
Trying to better ourselves
Giving up after one or two tries

The high school's a front for Yakuza
Everyone, everyone knows it
And we will all shortly be richer than God if we'll just hold on
As long as we play all our cards right
As long as nobody here blows it
I've drawn up a map of Rialto
The holding tank's full for the night
I heard all about it on citizens band, it's a brand new day
We'll be awake until Thursday
The future's disarmingly bright
============================================================
Design Your Own Container Garden
============================================================
I took to the highway, went out to Pico-Crenshaw
Old friends, old friends
I took to the highway, the highway took to me
Like a second skin
Rolled around in the evening, circling like a buzzard
Trouble in mind
Excavating the space we left behind

Yes I took trinkets with me, left them by the crater
Here ghosts, old ghosts
Smelled all the chlorine, I took the low road
Where the light was just right
Crawled around in the glowing, all-embracing wreckage
Sunburned and snow-blind
Excavating the space we left behind
============================================================
Deuteronomy 2:10
============================================================
The sun above me and a concrete floor below
Scratch at the chain links maybe bare my teeth for show
Fed twice a day I don't go hungry anymore
Feel in my bones just what the future has in store
I pace in circles so the camera will see
Look hard at my stripes, there'll be no more after me

Laze by the shoreline while the sailors disembark
Scratch out a place to sit and rest down in the dark
Smell something burning downwind just a little ways
They set up camp and sing and sweat and work for days
I have no fear of anyone I'm dumb and wild and free
I am a flightless bird and there'll be no more after me

In Costa Rica in a burrow underground
Climb to the surface, blink my eyes and look around
I'm all alone here as I try my tiny song
Claim my place beneath the sky but I won't be here for long
I sang all night the moon shone on me through the trees
No brothers left and there'll be no more after me
============================================================
Dilaudid
============================================================
The reception's gotten fuzzy
The delicate balance has shifted
Put on your gloves and black pumps
Let's pretend the fog has lifted
Now you see me, now you don't
Now you say you love me
Pretty soon you won't
If we get our full three score and ten
We won't pass this way again
So kiss me with your mouth open
Turn the tires toward the street
And stay sweet

All the chickens come on home to roost
Plump bodies blotting out the sky
You know it breaks my heart in half, in half
When I see them trying to fly
'Cause you just can't do things your body wasn't meant to
Hike up your fishnets, I know you
If we live to see the other side of this
I will remember your kiss
So do it with your mouth open
And take your foot off of the brake
For Christ's sake!
============================================================
Dinu Lipatti's Bones
============================================================
We stank of hair dye and ammonia
We sealed ourselves away from view
You were looking at the void and seldom blinking
The best that I could do
Was to train my eyes on you
We scaled the hidden hills beneath the surface
Scraped our fingers bloody on the stones
And built a little house that we could live in
Out of Dinu Lipatti's bones

We kept our friends at bay all summer long
Treated the days as though they'd kill us if they could
Wringing out the hours like blood-drenched bedsheets
To keep wintertime at bay
But December showed up anyway
There was no money, it was money that you wanted
I went downtown, sold off most of what I owned
And we raised a tower to broadcast all our dark dreams
From Dinu Lipatti's bones
============================================================
Dirt Island

Waves?
How are you?
Bite the Sea Gurls.
Smile green moss.
Hot? Humid?

============================================================
Dirty Old Town
============================================================
I found my love by the Gasworks croft
Dreamed a dream by the old canal
I kissed my girl by the factory wall
Dirty old town, dirty old town

The moon is shifting behind the cloud
Cats are crawling all along the beat
And spring's a girl in the street at night
Dirty old town, dirty old town

Heard a siren calling from the docks
Saw a train set the night on fire
I smelled the spring on the smoky wind
Dirty old town, dirty old town

I'm going to make a good sharp axe
Shining steel tempered in the fire
Will chop you down like an old dead tree
Dirty old town, dirty old town
============================================================
Distant Stations
============================================================
I found an old rock in the dry dirt outside
the door of my motel room.
it was a triangle with soft rounded edges
and a split down the middle of one corner.
it was darker than English moss.
green like the soft frills of a peacock's plume.
I waited for you, but I never told you where I was.
it was you who taught me how to write these kinds of equations.
I waited on the steps for you,
and I hid in the bushes whenever a car pulled into the parking lot.
you taught me how to listen to these distant stations.

I saw the sky break.
I threw a rock at a crow who was playing in the mulch of some rose bushes by the motel office.

I sang old songs from nowhere.

I said a small prayer for the poor and the naked and the hungry.

Divided Sky Lane
============================================================
Five years now
Since they dissolved our crew
Since the fence went up
That I can't cut through
Grass grows high
On the former site
Of the carefully tended garden
We visited late at night

See how the cracked moon climbs high
In the divided sky

Much blood shed
In the phantom zone
I'm a civilian now
I can't go home
Sweep my front steps
At dark each night
Tongue swollen with prayer
Stomach unbearably tight

See how the cracked moon climbs high
In the divided sky

Though the the frost bites hard
I maintain my guard
Good spies grow old
They never come in from the cold

Full information blackout
From the field, for me, I know
I will someday learn
How to let you go
Clench and unclench my fingers
Get it right someday
Find the place where the memories go dark
And they stay that way

See how the cracked moon climbs high
In the divided sky

Wheels down in Seattle
Three years ago in this town
They sent their best and brightest to me
I sent them all back down

Deluxe coach to the ballpark
There's champagne on the snack trays
Summon up the spirit of a brighter time
Looked bad last week against the Blue Jays

When my name was everywhere
None of you were there
When my name was everywhere

Potholes in the parking lot
You feel the jolts a little harder every year
The bat boy hands out yellow slickers
It never stops raining out here

When my name was everywhere
None of you were there
When my name was everywhere

When the speedball would squeal
With the highlight reel
When the headline hype
Was on the front page in extra large type
It was me, for all the world to see

Don’t call it a comeback
I've been here for years
Maximum respect to all the warriors
Who choose to fall down on their spears

When my name was everywhere
None of you were there
When my name was everywhere
============================================================
Doctor Wu
============================================================
Katy lied, I was halfway crucified
I was on the other side of no tomorrow
You walked in, and my life began again
Just when I'd spent the last piaster I could borrow
All night long we would sing that stupid song
And every word we sang I knew was true

Are you with me, Doctor Wu
Are you really just a shadow of the man that I once knew
Are you crazy, are you high
Or just an ordinary guy
Have you done all you can do
Are you with me doctor
Can you hear me doctor

Don't seem right, I've been strung out here all night
I was waiting for the taste you said you'd bring me
Biscayne Bay, where the Cuban gentlemen sleep all day
I went searching for the songs you used to sing to me
And Katy lies, you can see it in her eyes
So imagine my surprise when I saw you

Are you with me, Doctor Wu
Are you really just a shadow of the man that I once knew
She is lovely, yes, she's sly
And you're an ordinary guy
Has she finally got to you
Can you hear me doctor
Can you hear me
============================================================
Dogs of Clinic 17
============================================================
Three fresh meals every day
And one white pill to chase the chills away
And me, I know what it's all about
And we all know what it's like to have to go without

Five of us are left, that's down from twenty
But the guy in the white coat, he tells me that five is plenty
Yeah, one soft bed to rest my head upon
And me, I know what side my bread's buttered on

There's a light in the window
There's a light in all of us trying to get free
There's a light in all of you who hear my song
There's a virus eating its way through me
============================================================
Don't Take the Dogs Away
============================================================
Don't take the dogs away
Don't take the dogs away from me
Don't take the dogs away
Don't take the dogs away from me

You do this every time
You do this every time I swear
You do this every time
You do this every time I'm there

Just look around the house
Just look around the house we're in
What should I say to you?
Where do you want me to begin?

Don't take the dogs away
Don't take the dogs away from me
Don't take the dogs away
Don't take the dogs away from me
============================================================
Done Bleeding
============================================================
Recite the songs that kept me whole
On the day I hand over command control
Try to let them all flow in to this one

List alphabetically
The toxins the doctors found in me
During my time in prison

Count my fingers
Every last one
When I get done

Clean the floors well, sweep and swab
Do a thorough job
Leave the old place nicer than I found it

Wish well as the neighbors cheer and shout
Finally taking their earplugs out
Things were even worse here than they sounded

Grim faced pilots back from the bombing run
When I get done

Take a picture or two
Just to remember the view
Leave a mark on the door
As an empty warning sign
From one who's gone before
But isn't here any more

Let the crust form on my skin in the sun
When I get done

Sweep the front porch make it new
Put the broom away when I get through
No passers-by need to know of my lonely tenure

All this violent end
The shock of leaves
Wind rippling in my sleeves
Swirling against my skin as in a blender

Red thread drying behind me, hand-spun
When I get done
============================================================
Down Here
============================================================
On Venus, it rains sulfuric acid
But the raindrops evaporate before they hit the ground
Japanese red-crowned crane by the water here
Trouble in town
I feel like I'm gonna drown down here
It's all coming down down here

Hurricanes in from Australia
Tore up the neighborhood
A telegram from Lithuania
And the news is not good
And I don't speak the language down here
It's all coming down down here

Johnson Johnson is my name
Brooklyn is my station
Heaven is my resting place
And God is my salvation
============================================================
Down Here Where the Bullet Bills Are
============================================================
Such a long way to go
Such a strong pull from the upworld undertow
Nothing seems to happen when I wish upon a star
Down here where the Bullet Bills are

Such a long life to live
Only so much of myself left to give
We'd all stick together if we were standing on Zanzibar
It's just me and my cap down here where the Bullet Bills are

At the bottom of the maze
Knocked down all day, all day, every day for the rest of my days

Such a long line behind
I know why I'm here, not sure what you all have in mind
No one will remember this run, not gonna leave a memoir
Just a ghostly crackling afterglow down here where the Bullet Bills are
Where the Bullet Bills are
============================================================
Down to the Ark
============================================================
The candidates met up in North Dakota
And they donned their black robes there in the chapel hall
They said a brief invocation to their cloven-hoofed prince
And they signed their names in blood on the vestry wall

In Christ you know there's neither high nor low
And the void will claim all creatures small or bright
Seal up the borders or let everybody in
In the order of the serpent, there'll be neither left nor right

And we pull down our blindfolds
Reach out for the lever in the dark
Get a sticker for our shirts as we head into the sun
Proudly bearing the mark
Headed down to the ark

The applicants went down to Oklahoma
And they hired an accent coach to teach them the western twang
And several post-born babies learned the hard way
Vampires only kiss you when they've sharpened up their fangs, yeah

And as Minnesota fell, so went Missouri
We were meeting at VFWs in the snow
And we voted down the tax codes, and we voted down the war
So many names to choose from, just one way to go

And we pull down our blindfolds
Reach out for the lever in the dark
Get a sticker for our shirts as we head into the sun
Proudly bearing the mark
Headed down to the ark
============================================================
Downtown Seoul
============================================================
There was a new song on the air
I saw you coming across the square
And a white bird broke the dark Korean sky
As the rest of my life went by

You had your warm hand on my face
I took your index finger in between my teeth
And I held it gently in place
It was resting lightly on my tongue in there
I saw you shaking in the cold Korean air
There but for the grace of the lord of song
I would be this very second and I'm coming right along
You had your cardigan on
I looked toward the sky and the white bird was gone
I remember your eyelids
I remember your body now
============================================================
Dr. Seuss' Cup

============================================================
Dragon Squeeze
============================================================
I'm gonna put on my tail
Break out of jail
And do the dragon squeeze

Wrap my tail round my waist
And give you just a taste
Of the dragon squeeze

When I'm wearing my tail
There's no telling what I'll do
Might run around in a circle
Or give a big dragon squeeze to you
It's true

I'm gonna put my tail on
Head out to the lawn
And do the dragon squeeze

So if you come to town
Prepare to party on down
And do the dragon squeeze
Dragon squeeze, dragon squeeze
============================================================
Drug Life
============================================================
Hey, where's my pills
They were sitting on the windowsill
Should have known something was wrong
When last week you took my favorite bong
Now it's gone
You're messing with my drug life
Quit messing with my drug life

Dimebags flash up the Union Square
People walk in serotonin pairs
I remember it was only play
Devil sucking up the protégés
Just shuffle off through the golden mist
Take a number 'cause you're on my list
And later on Second Avenue
If it comes down to the drugs or you
Baby, we're through
Because you're messing with my drug life
You're messing with my drug life, yeah
Quit messing with my drug life
Na na na na
============================================================
Duane Allman Slept Here
============================================================
Bag of sweet red licorice in my coat pocket
Kate's phone number breaking up and blurring in my brain
I have to find myself a doorway to rest in
Up for three days smoking rock cocaine

I got an idea to head down to Cable airport
Maybe hijack a little two seat plane
Maybe put the fear of God on my old friends down below
Up for three days smoking rock cocaine

I got five minutes sleep, it was an accident
My eyes look like grapes, sticky and overripe
I get the dates and times wrong all the time
I'm too young to get the dates and times wrong
Up for three days lips around the pipe

I will come to see you it's inevitable
Some wood may warp, but you probably can't change the grain
I'm not who you think I am, the person you thought you knew is gone
Up for three days smoking rock cocaine
Up for three days smoking rock cocaine
============================================================
Duke Ellington
============================================================
Light hit the rings
Glimmering on his fingers
The light came down
And his hands hit the keys
It utterly wasted me
In Sweden

Horns punched the air
The aftermath fell around everywhere
I saw the spotlight land on his rings
And I'd had just about enough losing things
In Sweden, in 1962
Quite some distance from you
============================================================
Dutch Orchestra Blues
============================================================
Somewhere in secret, the Dutch orchestra's playing
Somewhere in secret, the Dutch orchestra's playing real nice
Real nice

And they play so quiet, you can hear the passing traffic
And they play so quiet, you can hear the passing traffic
And the cars buzz by, and the wind blows
And I may walk past, and I may not
And someone may notice, or it may all slide right by
And you may love me, or you may not love me at all anymore
But the sun will shine on Holland in the spring
And God will watch over the members of the orchestra for me
With all his available energies
Yeah yeah
============================================================
Early Spring
============================================================
The pictures that you paint aren't as pretty as they once seemed to me
And the coffee's bitter 'cause it's been boiling too long
And the jokes you tell aren't as funny as they once seemed to me
And the songs you sing are just plain hackneyed
But the stars shine down on all god's children
And the sun sets on the good and on the evil
And I know you
And I know you

The throbbing flowers outside, I get it
And the paint peeling from the bathroom wall
And the smile on your face, it's a lie
And the smile on your face is real pretty
And the sun shines down on all god's children
And the stars burn for the good and the evil
And I know you
And I know you
============================================================
Earth Air Water Trees
============================================================
Through the shifting colors in the sky
I heard the wild geese call
And the light was bright and clear and cold
Over eastern Montreal
And although I know
You're only toying with me now
And although you hold
Your affection for me like a bone on a string
I love you, I love you because
You gave me sausage and cheese when I was hungry

You hold your closed hand out to me
And you told me to guess what you had inside
And I had a thousand guesses and some of them were good
But I knew for sure that I was losing my mind
When the scent came rising
Through the spaces between your fingers
When the scent called to me
And I knew we'd last at least 'til the end of December
And I love you, I love you because
You gave me sausage and cheese when I was hungry
============================================================
Edvard Munch
============================================================
Brand new colors on the eastern sky
The blinding symmetry, the little white lie
Your small hand waving in the cold air
The ridges of the mountain frozen on the skyline there
When the sun came out over Norway today
I saw you going away
There was nothing good in your going
There was nothing good in your going

I cut the flowers that grew near the door
And I arranged them in the center of the floor
And the room was so empty
There were pale shadows inside
When the sun came out over Norway today
I saw you going away
There was nothing good in your going
There was nothing good in your going
============================================================
Eleven Bands
============================================================
Follow the path up the foot of the mountain.
Follow the twisting branches.
When you look at them
Remember that they are alive, growing still.
See their colors lighten, as you climb.
Watch the sunlight catch them and reflect them.
It reflects them everywhere.

One of these paths leading up the nameless mountain
Was the one that told you something once.
But you will not find it here.
It has shriveled up and wriggled off the mountain.
Like a dying vine.
Once these things take on their weightlessness,
The structure comes apart.

How do the trees grow in this weather?
It is freezing cold.
Take the map on up the mountain side.
And all the sounds from far and wide will leave you suddenly.
And sugared winds come through the clouds.

Elijah
============================================================
Streak the windows, smear the walls with coconut oil yeah
Fill a cast-iron kettle with water and magnolia blossom
Let it boil
Let the water roll
Let the fire take its toll, I'm coming home
I'm coming home

Dust off the idols, give them something to eat
I think they're hungry, I know I'm starving half to death
I know you're waiting
I know you've been waiting for a long, long time
And I'm coming home
Coming home

Set the table those three extra places
One for me, one for your doubts, and one for God

Let the incense burn
In every room
Feel the fullness of time
In the empty tomb
Feel the future
Kicking in your womb
I'm coming home
I'm coming home

Elizabeth Barrett Browning

i saw the building burning down.
i saw the dogs come running in two by two.
i saw the building burning down.
i saw the dogs come running in two by two.
i saw the feast of saint christopher beginning.
i drew connecting lines between these things.

you say i need to get some sleep.
you say i need to take it easy for a while.
you say i'll never learn to swim at this rate,
but i'm waiting for you downstairs
and the water's rushing in on me.

so i guess the wheel's been set in motion.
i guess the ship, it's gone and left its little harbor.
i guess we'll wait and see what happens to us next.
and i can't wait because there's rats in the walls.

there are rats in the walls.
there are rats in the walls.
there are rats in the walls.
there are rats in the walls.

there are rats beneath the floorboards,
rats up in the ceiling.
rats in the walls,
there are rats in the walls.
============================================================
Emerging
============================================================
I am hungry but I'm not cold
I'm starving but the suit keeps me warm
And the light hits me full in the face
As I assume my new and dreadful form

Kick an incubator open
And like a flower in bloom
Sustenance, blessed sustenance
Oozing from the tomb
I know that sleeping bodies hide
Sweet things inside

And in the ever-present light
And in my ever-growing needs
If a man should crest the ridge
He's gonna have to watch me feed

But no one's ever gonna come
And nobody's gonna know
I will sail home again
Concealed among the upright walking men
To know that sleeping bodies hide
Sweet things inside
============================================================
Ending the Alphabet
============================================================
We got the brightest skylight
Like a vision of heaven on the evening sky
And a clock tower two blocks from the spot
Where I'm standing tonight

The avenues are throbbing with people
And the late sunlight makes them all look like angels
And the transformation is seamless
They are unbearably bright
I can almost hear their voices
As I walk past them all toward the water
What is there left in a city like this
When everyone you know has gone
I saw the wind wash them all away
And I was freezing
============================================================
Enoch 18:14
============================================================
I saw some old friends as I came to the city gate
They asked me where I'd been of late
I hadn't been anywhere but what was I going to say
Two hopeful people looking at me that way
You and your brother
You both escaped the curse
You can't comprehend what it's like

We stood in the sunlight and they asked me where I'd been
Held the gate open, told me to come on in
I saw the damp green grass so nice on the other side
Couldn't explain myself to them but I tried
You and your brother
You both escaped the curse
So you can't comprehend what it's like

Ground was dry but giving, the sky was nearly black
Saw some old friends when I looked back
Remember my old home, haven't forgotten yet
What happens on the day when I forget
You and your brother
You both escaped the curse
So you can't comprehend what it's like
============================================================
Escape to Wild Palm City
============================================================
I see you've come to call, you want to tear the palm tree down.
But I mean to tell you me and the palm tree we don't need you around.
We don't need you.
We don't need anyone else.
'Cause we can rip our roots up from the cool soft ground
All by ourselves.

And you come toward the two of us with your arms extended lovingly,
But I've got a hammer.

Sweat breaks on my temples as I see you come toward me.
And I should've known that this was exactly how it was gonna be.

What have I done to deserve this?
What did I ever do?
What have I done to deserve this?
What did I do to you?

And you come toward the two of us with your arms extended lovingly,
But I've got a hammer.

Estate Sale Sign
============================================================
Crude little wooden idols
And aviator shades
The trinkets and the treasures we
brought back from the Crusades
Some guy in an Impala shakes his
head when he rides by
But I remember when we shared
a vision, you and I

Worked hard to build this altar
We made it earn its keep
The cracks across its surface
spiderweb while we're asleep
The sacrificial stains all
spreading out and soaking through
But I remember when
we kept it pretty, me and you

And high above the water
The eagle spots the fish
Every martyr in this jungle
Is gonna get his wish

Stock shots stupid stock shots
From the Pomona mall
Set up like unloved icons
gathering dust up on the wall
From films no one remembers
They call down silently
But I remember when their names
were dear to you and me
Yeah

Pennies on the dollar
Everything's gotta go
The things that we
can't even give away
I don't wanna know
Try to see if secrets burn when
you hold them up into the light
I remember when we loved
each other day and night

And high above the water
The eagle spots the fish
Every martyr in this jungle
Is gonna get his wish
============================================================
Ethiopians
============================================================
Window mounted air conditioning unit
Humming like a hive
We want to send postcards to the friends we used to have
Rub their noses in the ugly fact that we are still alive
And we play lovers' reggae
On accordion and banjo when the moon is high
And we lie on the floor
Get suspicious of the people who've just moved in next door

The bad taste in our mouths
The twinkle in your eye
Good things never last
Bad things never die

Wind chime from Tahiti that we found down at the auction
Tolls its minor chord
And I can't think of one thing in this whole wide blessed world
That's more dangerous and frightening than you when you get bored
And we go through scads of money
Don't know where it comes from, don't know where it goes
And we stare out the window
See the poison flowers the neighbors grow
Sprouting up in nice neat rows

The swelling in our limbs
The twinkle in your eye
Good things never last
Bad things never die
============================================================
Etiquette Song
============================================================
Rain washing your memory away
Fires burning somewhere around here
Clouds forming, clouds gathering
One minute in a long, long year
You've got one good reason for doing what you're going to do
I've got one thing holding me back from doing the same thing to you

In the San Gabriels the fire ate away
Rabbit-brush and the jimson weed
When the rain came it was like an old friend
When you came by you had just what I needed

You've got one hour left before something happens alright
And then the rain will come down tonight
============================================================
Etruscans
============================================================
Sift through the things we had that seem worth fighting for
Dig through the embers
Seek out a witness to the times we used to share
We doubt the pretenders

Go and find you an Etruscan

Reveal the hidden truth about the serpent's tooth
Try not to get romantic
Tell tales about white whales, way out in the Atlantic

Go and find you an Etruscan

Seek out his dwelling place, describe his face for the record
Seek out the feral child, head out into the wild
Send word when you get there
I'll wait here day and night, hoping you'll be alright
Sadly knowing better

Go and find you an Etruscan
Go and find you an Etruscan
============================================================
Eugene Sue
============================================================
When the sky opens wide
And the late winter rain goes wild
I don't like it
And I curse God to His face

And I say to myself
And to anyone else who will listen
Save yourselves
Or hang yourselves
But I am leaving this wretched place

But when you call down curses
On the God that made you
You play hide and seek with trouble
Trouble's gonna find you too

When the ship finds land
And they throw me onto the sand
There's a guy with a rifle
Waiting there

And I say
To nobody listening
"This is fine by me"
And ideas fly through my mind
The sweat cakes my hair

Yeah, when you call down curses
On the God that made you
You play hide and seek with trouble
Yes, the trouble's gonna find you too
============================================================
Evening in Stalingrad
============================================================
When you were nineteen I first laid eyes on you
The small stream that ran through the center of town carried your name to me
Your hair was dark and your eyes were a frosty blue
And then they put me in jail 'til you were twenty-three

When you were twenty-four we took to drinking and dancing
We boxed with our shadows like a couple of kangaroos
And then we went down to Chechnya for the weekend
Your eyes were glacial and your promises all rang true

And things are happening here while we sleep
I can feel it in my boiling brain
And I'm dreaming in blood-red color
When I see the Stolypin car riding through the light rain
They'll have to carry me out on my back
They'll have to tear me to pieces, alright
We are warm in our hidden room down here
We've got stars in our eyes tonight
============================================================
Exegetic Chains
============================================================
Look closely at the shadows on the ground beneath the trees
The labors of Hercules
Wild grasses on the hills
Rippling in the wind
Cybele unchained

The songs you sing at Christmastime
The stories that you tell
Well, I knew them well
Yes, I knew them well

Say your prayers to whomever you call out to in the night
Keep the chains tight
Make it through this year
If it kills you outright

The coins they toss at dancers whirling in the city square
Music on the air
The places where we met to share our secrets now and then
We will see them again

Change will come
Stay warm inside the ripple of the Panasonic hum
It grinds and it roars
Headed somewhere better
If I have to crawl there on all fours

Say your prayers to whomever you call out to in the night
Keep the chains tight
Make it through this year
If it kills you outright
============================================================
Extraction Point
============================================================
You never learn to tell the difference between
The probable projections and the best parts of the dream
The fragments that stick with you, the ones you really feel
Those parts aren't real

But high in the cold Midwestern air
They shimmer before us there
Almost out of reach but not quite
Stay up thinking about it all night
Waited so long for days like these
I'm tired of living on my knees

Pull your hair back tight, head right for the extraction point
And if you don't hear from me let them all go free

I'm on the Kennedy Expressway at dawn
Don't know where we got this car from
I'm driving with the fog lights on
The angles you don't plan for, the things you might have missed
Those things exist

But under the waxing winter sun
I feel like we're almost gone
Just pick a lane and drive right through
Headed off to freedom with you
Dreams of the future up in the front of my mind
Leave a couple dozen bodies behind

Pull your hair back tight, head right for the extraction point
And if you don't hear from me let them all go free
============================================================
Extreme South Number 1

In the little house
On the beach
Underneath
The dwarf peach tree I've got
Coca-Cola
On my tongue
Yeah, sweet taste in my mouth
Borne down
Past Venezuela
Extreme south

South American red-capped woodpecker
In the high trees drumming
In the wet sand
I see you coming
Comfort burning
In your eyes
Yeah, sweet taste in my mouth
Borne down
Around the Horn
Extreme south

Ezekiel 7 and the Permanent Efficacy of Grace
============================================================
The clouds explode and then the desert blooms
Someone will need to mop this floor for me
When I emerge I find my car
Like a cathedral in a dream of the future

Drive till the rain stops
Keep driving

Pull over and blast off when I get the chance
Clear as an insect's wings in sunlight
Flip on the high stakes radio
Try to sing the words right

Drive till the rain stops
Keep driving

I had his arms tied up behind him
We were together all day
Maybe make Culiacán by sunset
Try to anyway

High as the clouds now
Flying
Drive till the rain stops
Keep driving
============================================================
FM
============================================================
Hurry the bottle mama, it's grapefruit wine
Kick off your high-heeled sneakers, it's party time
The girls don't seem to care what's on
As long as it plays 'til dawn
No static at all

Give her some fucked up music, she treats you nice
Feed her some hungry reggae, she'll love you twice
The girls don't seem to care tonight
As long as the mood is right
No static at all
No static at all
Hey!

Faithless Bacchant Song
============================================================
Somewhere in the damn forest
Where the fat vines look like my brother's arms
Thick and ripe
I'm trying to get out for days and these green vines
Keep getting in my way
I came up to a clearing
Where the crosscurrents cooled my face
I would've sat down there in the middle
I would've rested just a little
But for the fire-bellied toads
See the ground was wet and they were everywhere
Fire-bellied toad number five
From what may or may not have been a limited series
Opened up his little mouth
As though to speak
And then he spoke
And then he spoke to me, and he said
You can't holler down our rain barrel
You can't climb our apple tree
I don't want to play in your yard
If you won't be good to me
Honey it was downright creepy
============================================================
Fall of the Star High School Running Back
============================================================
sophomore year, you rushed for an average of eight and a third yards per carry.
all eyes were on you.
junior year, you blew your knee out at an out of town game.
nowhere to go to but down down down.
nothing but the ground left for you to fall to.

by July, you'd made a whole bunch of brand new friends,
people you used to look down on.
and you'd figured out a way to make real money --
givin' ends to your friends, and it felt stupendous.
chrome spokes on your Japanese bike,
but selling acid was a bad idea.
and selling it to a cop was a worse one.
and the new law said that seventeen year olds could do federal time.
you were the first one, so I sing this song for you,
William Staniforth Donahue,
your grandfather rode the boat over from Ireland,
but you made a bad decision or two.
yeah.
============================================================
Family Happiness
============================================================
As we cruised across
The Canadian border
You reached into your handbag
Pulled out a micro-cassette recorder
Started quoting Tolstoy into the machine
I had no idea what you meant
I guess I'm supposed to figure these things out
Or maybe it's supposed to be self-evident
But I've gone feral
And I don't speak the language anymore
We're headed deep into the forest
I've got the pedal to the floor
The engine shudders like a dying man
When you reach out to grab my hand
You can bring out all your weapons
You can't make me go to war

Long winding Canadian highways
Innumerable evergreens
Weather forecast on the AM radio
Says we'll be expecting highs in the low teens
When I mouth my silent curses at you
I can see my breath
I hope the stars don't even come out tonight
I hope we both freeze to death
Look at the person I've turned into
Tell me how do you like him now
No standards of any kind to break, no creeds to disavow
I am right here where you want me
Do what you brought me out here for
You can arm me to the teeth
You can't make me go to war
============================================================
Fault Lines
============================================================
down here where the heat's so fine
I'll drink to your health and you drink to mine
as we try to make the money we scored out in Vegas
hold out for a while
we drink vodka from Russia
we get our chocolates from Belgium
we have our strawberries flown in from England.
yeah but none of the money we spend
seems to do us much good in the end.
I've got a cracked engine block, both of us do.
yeah the house and the jewels, the Italian race car
they don't make us feel better about who we are.
I've got termites in the framework, so do you.

down here where the watermelon grows so sweet
where I worship the ground underneath of your feet,
we are experts in the art of frivolous spending.
and it's gone on like this, for 3 years I guess
and we're drunk all the time and our lives are a mess.
and the deathless love we swore to protect with our bodies
is stumbling across its bleak ending.
but none of the rage in our eyes seems to finish it off where it lies.
I got sugar in the fuel lines, both of us do.
yeah the fights and the lies that we both love to tell
fail to send our love to its reward down in hell
I got pudding for a backbone, so do you!
la la la la.
hey hey!

Stood near the cage of the prize-fighting cock
The sun cut through the clouds but the air pressure dropped
And I touched your hair for the very first time
I have that moment with me now, it's all mine
And you showed me a thing or two about power
In its purest form

A few minutes later, you went back inside
And I stood near the clothesline where strips of beef dried
Hanging in the noon-day sun
Flies were buzzing nearby
And then your face in the window caught my eye
And you showed me a thing or two about power
In its purest form

Things don't look much different now from where I stand
Looking for you, camera in hand
Someone's gone away and someone's gotten taller
But the world stopped turning and the universe is much smaller
Since you showed me a thing or two about power
In its purest form
Yeah you showed me a thing or two about power
In its purest form

Two blinded in Detroit!
Something must be done
Jaws dropping at ringside
In the blood tide
When the fireball hits

Down Indiana way
Make 'em check their guns
Real tears when it's over
Smell the sulfur
When the dark vault splits

Lord of the hidden pocket knife
Tawdry dreams all come to life
Save yourselves
Save this town, save everything not nailed down

War in Ontario! Dead before the bell
Crushed hopes of the young breed
All the best bleed
All the proud boys break

Who will stand before the flood?
Who will mop up all the blood?
Who alone?
Skin, bone, steel, stone
Swim or drown
Save this town, save everything not nailed down

First Blood

Mail order body armor
Map to the Blue Bucket Mine
Guy who had a place down by the lakeside
Changing water to wine
Devastating schematics
Rough drafts of the twenty-third psalm
Paul Kersey never left his apartment
John Rambo never went to Vietnam

Armor-piercing black talons
From the first production run
Nobody's seen them in a while
Since 1991
Out in the cul-de-sacs at midnight
Where the candy for the cannons comes from
I heard Buford Pusser was dirty
John Rambo never went to Vietnam

Shall we rise to the occasion
Or go to sleep for good in the trenches?
Dug in beneath a brilliant blue sky
Helmets hanging high in the branches
Empty vessels by the dozen
Diamonds in the sun
We worship nothing in the foxholes
John Rambo never went to Vietnam
John Rambo never went to Vietnam

First Few Desperate Hours
============================================================
Bad luck comes in from Tampa
Bad luck comes in from Tampa
On the back of a truck
Doing ninety up the interstate
We have bad dreams the night he rolls in
We have bad dreams the night he rolls in
And we try to keep our sprits high
But they flag and they wane
When the truck pulls up out front
In the light spring rain
And they sag like withering flowers
Let the good times roll on
Through these first few desperate hours

Yeah the driver drops his cargo at the curb
The driver drops his cargo at the curb
And the sun peeks in
Like a killer through the curtain
And when cloven hoof prints turn up in the garden
Yeah when cloven hoof prints turn up in the garden
We keep up the good fight
We keep our spirits light
But they draw like flies
And there's a stomach-churning shift
In the way the land lies
And they lean like towers
On a hillside struggling to stand
Through these first few desperate hours
Yeah
============================================================
Five O'Clock
============================================================
They say tomorrow's ended
We found a place to stay
Well, moments last forever
And never go away
And that's the way it should be
I still recall the best times
I just gave everything to you
It's then you see, the truth just turns to lies
It's then you see, the truth was in your eyes

I'm motionless, I'm left behind
Your nature was to be unkind
You deal the cards, you win the game
My life can never be the same
And if I was to say to you "Please go away"
If I was...
And if I was to say to you "Please go away"
============================================================
Flashing Lights
============================================================
I am wearing a white long-sleeved button-down
The pink colors behind the clouds tonight
Mirror the softer shades of your nightgown
As the neuro-transmitters go crazy inside of me
You swear you're leaving town
Empty promises, empty promises

I am watching the way the wind seems to pass straight through your body
When you run your fingernail along my neck, and you spill some water on me
You say you're as good as gone
Well, don't look now but here comes the dawn
Empty promises, empty promises
Empty promises, empty promises
============================================================
Flight 717: Going to Denmark
============================================================
Your bright eyes render all discussion pointless
Your bright eyes are gonna kill me for sure
I look at you and I know that the house will come down
Because your burning eyes are bright and pure

But there's a room for us
In a red brick building
By a bright green field
In Denmark

I've got a twitch in my leg and it makes me nervous
And I've got fifty cents in my watch pocket
And your name beating march time in my blood
Putting pressure on the hollows of my eye sockets

There's a room for us
In a red brick building
By a bright green field
In a very old country

My mouth is open
So you can stuff the bright red roses in
'Cause I feel the California sky closing in

There's a room for us
On the third floor of a red brick building
By a green field with a stream running through it in Denmark
Yeah

Flower Song
============================================================
Selling new flowers outrageously cheap
Freshly cut daisies, twenty five cents each
You loved me when you could keep your losses down
But winter's coming around now
Now, now, now

The girl at the flower shop is kind and young
She made accurate change for me
I let the change come
And you loved me when it was cheap to do so
Can you feel the cold wind blow now
Now, now, now

For Charles Bronson
============================================================
Catch a lucky break, try to make it last
Rig a blanket curtain up between
the present and the past

Play my lucky numbers
for most of what they're worth
Lie about my age right down
to my last day on this earth

Set your sights on good fortune
Concentrate
Pull back the hammer
Try to hold the gun straight

Hit the gym each night,
stay cool and seldom speak
Keep the heart of a champion
Never let them see you're weak

And whatever they say
on your page three mention
Focus on the parts
that make you feel good
Be grateful for the attention

Set your sights on good fortune
Concentrate
Pull back the hammer
Try to hold the gun straight

Try to hold the gun straight
And true
And steady
Let the frame find you
when the cameraman's ready

Work until I drop
Drift from place to place
Ehrenfeld, Pennsylvania
scratched into my face

Set your sights on good fortune
Concentrate
Pull back the hammer
Try to hold the gun straight
Try to hold the gun straight

For the Krishnacore Bands
============================================================
You stuck by the scene, but did the scene stick by you?
In a few cases, yes
Maybe in one or two
You routinely got called out
by Maximum Rock 'n Roll
And you weren't ever going to fit in
At the Fireside Bowl

Back in the day, punks
Practically declaring war
As if there were anything
More orthodox than hardcore
As if there were anything more orthodox than hardcore

You stuck to your guns when you were running out of ammo
Even on package tours supporting metalcore guys in camo
Find more common threads than you'd expect to in these places
Always see the holy name light up a few new faces

And back in the day, punks
Still with plenty of shit to say
Covertly cashing in
On dead stock of your early demos on eBay

Where were they on the night you first shaved your head?
Drinking beer in a field someplace
With all creation overhead
And where were they when the locals were ganging up on you?
Lining up to join some nearly-identical crew

You stuck it out for several years or maybe you moved on
Nobody's really sure where Jayadvaita's gone
Some say he's a stoner now
Creeper Dave swears that's true
But when you point one finger at the Krishna punks
I've got two fingers up for you

And back in the day, punks
Singing the same old song
About the kids who brought the banquet to the matinee
But preached just a little too long
Yeah, they preached just a little too long
============================================================
For the Portuguese Goth Metal Bands
============================================================
Set the spectrum for the greyscale, that's better
Favor bold fonts in blackletter
Star-crossed lovers and their tragic fates
And that one Celtic Frost record
Almost everybody hates

Candlelight playing its tricks on the walls of the cave
Hauling these songs to the night from the mouth of the grave

Mark the map out for the treasure don't say where
Find the octave in the shadow and stay there
Sleep till sunset, stay up late
Bleed bile all night
Into an SM58

Candlelight playing its tricks on the walls of the cave
Hauling these songs to the night from the mouth of the grave

Finally head west, but it's a dead end
Come home dead broke but still among friends
Keep what's precious, drop what's not
Without a second thought
There's not so many of us
But you don't know any of us
Work like a gravedigger, let the blood spill
Headline really big festivals
Every other summer in Brazil

Candlelight playing its tricks on the walls of the cave
Hauling these songs to the night from the mouth of the grave
============================================================
For the Snakes
============================================================
All your brambles, all your creeping vines
All of the trash that people leave behind
All your fine, fine columns poking up through the pond scum
We will have uses for these things when we come

Cracks in the marble you hauled in from the quarry
These will be seen by all in their glory
Long hidden shadows of the places they came from
We will bring memories of these things when we come

All your abandoned things
Once fine vestments, statues with wings
They have their uses, every one
Let me slither across them in the sun

Pale imitations that you brought back from afar
We will show them to you as they are
Wind through the ruins, high and lonesome
We will have uses for these things when we come
============================================================
Foreign Object
============================================================
Whipped like a dog, down on the cards
Square in the spotlight sweating real hard
All soaked in blood like a newborn babe
Sharp thing hidden in my hand shaped like an astrolabe

Gonna stick you in the eye with a foreign object
Gonna poke you in the eye with a foreign object

March through the red mist, never get my vision clear
Learn to love this kind of atmosphere
Strike funny poses, keep my weapon hand low
Whip my head around a little, get blood on the front row

Gonna jab you in the eye with a foreign object
I personally will stab you in the eye with a foreign object
Foreign object, foreign object, foreign object

Sink my teeth into your scalp, take a nice big bite
Save nothing for the cameras, play the angles all night
One of these days my legs will both snap like twigs
If you can't beat ’em make 'em bleed like pigs

I'm gonna jab you in the eye with a foreign object
I'm gonna stab you in the eye with a foreign object

Ba, ba da da, ba ba ba da, foreign object
Ba, ba da da, ba ba ba da, foreign object
Ba, ba da da, ba ba ba da, foreign object

Fortune Came Today
============================================================

Fortune came today
And left me a check for a new something else
Colorforms and rotting felt
Crocodiles and putrid smelt
Can't let me say
Fortune came today

Four New Trees
============================================================
The first new tree is tall and good
It gives hard dark brown burning wood
When winter comes it stands right outside
With its blossom-laden arms spread wide

The second new tree gives out sweet sticky fruit
And it took a long time to take root
Sometimes we thought it had given up the spirit
But now it makes me happy when I'm just standing near it

The third new tree stands just west of the barn
Its best branch is no thicker than my arm
I will water him everyday
And I will chase all the termites away

But the fourth new tree is my enemy
Yeah the fourth new tree shouldn't be here
The fourth new tree
Sets its tendrils through the water mains and tries to poison me
His leaves are thick, and always falling, and pure

He's a god and oh can he dance
He has sex when the lights are down low
There's one thing I just gotta know

Francis Mitterrand, do you have the heater on?
Francis Mitterrand, do you have the heater on?

Shows love for the people he rules
He knows French, diplomatically cool
He has sex every hour of the day
There's one thing I really wanna say

Free Fallin'
============================================================
She's a good girl, loves her mama
She loves horses and her boyfriend too
She's a good girl, she's crazy about Elvis
She loves Jesus and America too

And it's a long day, living in Reseda
There's a freeway running through the yard
And I'm a bad boy 'cause I don't even miss her
I'm a bad boy for breaking her heart

But I'm free
I'm free fallin'
Yes I'm free
I'm free fallin'

All the vampires living in the valley
Move west down Ventura Boulevard
And all the bad boys are standing in the shadows
And the good girls lie at home with broken hearts

But me I'm free
I'm free fallin'
Yes I'm free
I'm free fallin'

I'm gonna glide down over Mulholland
I'm gonna write your name in the sky
I'm gonna free fall out into nothing
I'm gonna leave this world for awhile

And I'm free
I'm free fallin'
Yeah I'm free

Fresh Berries for You
============================================================
The world's overrun with new shades of green
And the dandelions come up like recurring dreams
And the swallows give up their fragile little songs
To the new world

And I know you're only watching out for yourself
And I know I'm not to take it real personal-like
And I know you only want what's best for everybody
I know you only want what's best for everybody

But you better be nice or the Easter Bunny's
Gonna strike your name out of the
Little red book with the silver hinges on it
That he carries

They've implemented a new system on the exhaust lines of the buses
And now the air is fresh and sweet and clean when they pass by
And the bright sun shines down on our fair city
And young cats play on people's front lawns

And the time is coming
And the time is coming
And I can feel the time coming
And I know that you can feel the time coming yourself

And the Easter Bunny's coming
And God knows I'd hate for you to miss it

It's gonna be so nice
When the Easter Bunny comes
It's gonna be so nice
When the Easter Bunny comes
It's gonna be so nice
When the Easter Bunny comes
It's gonna be so nice
When the Easter Bunny comes

Fresh Cherries in Trinidad
============================================================
When I woke up on Saturday and you came in
And you brought the sunlight in
I felt sleep slipping away from me
I feel things occasionally like this
Fresh cherries
Hanging from your fingers

When the water on the window let the sunlight through
And I got a good look at you
Standing above me bright and tall
There are no words for it
There are no words at all, I saw
Fresh cherries
Hanging from your fingers
============================================================
Fresh Tattoo
============================================================
Tattoo of the seventh shield
Still wet on my skin
You're all crumpled up at the curb there
I think I'm going to take you in
Always had to follow my instincts
Usually I'm out on my own
You there by the road, wet and helpless
What happens if I take you home?

Well, you may forget the whys and wheres
Of an old tattoo on your forearm there
But usually you recall the day you got one
And usually it fades in the sun

Headed for a season in exile
As the oracle predicted
According to reliable sources
In thirty days I'm getting evicted
Trying not to scratch where it itches
It takes a certain level of discipline
Not even half a second by the light switch
Let the future flood right in

Well, you may forget the whys and wheres
Of an old tattoo on your forearm there
But usually you recall the day you got one
And usually it fades in the sun

Usually the lines grow faint
Like old house paint
Just a way to mark the years gone by
You lay on the couch three weeks
Until the color came back into your cheeks
I'd seen ones like you before
Plenty came through before

Legend on the shield in Greek
"What's that say?" you said
I gave you an answer that I thought you'd buy
All of this will disappear in the twinkling of an eye

Well, you may forget the whys and wheres
Of an old tattoo on your forearm there
But usually you recall the day you got one
And usually it fades in the sun
But not this one
============================================================
Friend of the Devil
============================================================
I lit out from Reno, I was trailed by twenty hounds
Didn't get to sleep last night 'til morning came around
I set out running but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

Ran into the devil boys, he loaned me twenty bills
Spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills
I set out running but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

Ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there
Took my twenty dollar bill and vanished in the air
Set out running but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night
The first one's named Sweet Anne Marie, and she's my heart's delight
The second one is prison babe, the sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail

Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee
The first one says she's got my child, but he don't look like me
I set out running but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

From TG&Y
============================================================
Out behind the Safeway
Just before the flood
Huffed some cans of spray paint
And begin to vomit blood
One more night in this town's
Gonna break me I just know
Hang on to your dreams 'til someone makes you let them go

Stumbled on down Indian Hill
Tail between my legs
Sick taste in my mouth
Folgers Crystals and hard boiled eggs
If I can't run away tonight
I don't know what I'll do
Hang on to your dreams 'til someone beats them out of you

Do what you have to do
Go where you have to go
When the time comes to loosen up your grip, you'll know

Called my friend in New York
Three thousand miles away
Halfway through her metamorphosis
Nothing I could say
Hoard my small resentments
Like rare and priceless gems
Hang on to your dreams until there's nothing left of them
============================================================
From the Lake Trials
============================================================
Remind ourselves each day
Of what we crawled up from and who we are
Clean myself like a cat
Who spent too long beneath a car

Everything goes still
Between the present moment and the dawn
All God's creatures freeze up
When you flip the high beams on

Long live the machines
Long live the machines
Long live these blissful carcasses
With their bones picked clean

Bad dreams, bad dreams
With a panoramic view
Make a list of things to beat the dreams back
Follow through, follow through

Swim to shore, scramble up
Maybe make it through the clearing to the road
All God's creatures hold their breath if they have to
Until their lungs explode

Long live the machines
That never learned to work quite right
Long live the permanent on-going blink
Of the engine light
Of the engine light
============================================================
From the Nebraska Plant
============================================================
I recall the curb
Waiting for the bus
Flaky yellow paint
What's become of us?

Searching in the snow
For something in the distance
When the vision comes
I have no resistance

It's one of several iterations
It gets hard to keep track
On your custom Kawasaki
With the stinger on the back

Walk across the bridge
Used to get so scared
Signed out AMA
No one really cared

It wasn't in your nature
Taking in the strays
But you handed me your helmet
I clung to you for days

But I am strong now, I am strong now
That was all years back
On your custom Kawasaki
Chrome yellow and black

It's somewhere in a wreckyard now
Never see it again on this earth
Let the scavengers proclaim
How much it was worth

Out here on the median
Not sure what to do
Figure something's got to happen sometime
I wait all day for you

Flak jacket full of holes
Kevlar coated and dusty black
On your custom Kawasaki with the stinger on the back
============================================================
Full Flower

I saw the ceiling spin
And I saw the room shift
And I watched the television flicker
And I let my mind drift
And I would give anything in the world up for you
But I will not stop

I saw the blossom form
And I saw the screen glow
And I let my arm fall to my side
And I took one step back
I would give anything in the world up for you
But I will not stop

Game Shows Touch Our Lives
============================================================
Dug up a fifth of Hood River gin
That stuff tastes like medicine
But I'll take it
It'll do

On the couch in the living room all day long
Music on the television playing our song
And I'm in the mood
The mood for you

Turn the volume up real high
All of that money look at it fly
And you smoking like a chimney
Shadows crawled across the living room's length
I held onto you with a desperate strength
With everything with everything in me
And I handed you a drink of the lovely little thing
On which our survival depends
People say friends don't destroy one another
What do they know about friends?

Thunderclouds forming cream white moon
Everything's going to be okay soon
Maybe tomorrow
Maybe the next day

Carried you up the stairs that night
All of this could be yours if the price is right
I heard cars headed down to oblivion
Up on the expressway
Your drunken kisses as light as the air
Maybe everything that falls down eventually rises
Our house sinking into disrepair
Ah but look at this showroom filled with fabulous prizes
============================================================
Garbage Eaters
============================================================
I recognise your dirty face
I know you from uptown
Hold your head high
Hold your head high

We're going to colonise this place
And stop the sun from going down
By and by, alright
By and by

Keep your countenance as bright as can be
And hold the dumpster open for me

The water level's going down
The table's never going to rise
We will be alright
We will be alright

Come in alone, go out alone
Feel lonesome in between
Keep your hands wet
In the red clay

Let your light be a beacon to cruel and heartless men
Learn from your mistakes, then make the same mistakes again
============================================================
Genesis 19:1-2
============================================================
The girl who'd been haunting your dreams all your life
The butcher from Brooklyn, the butcher's wife
The girl who kissed you in the seventh grade
Her and all the others lined up behind the gate
The two angels came to Sodom in the evening
When the sun up in the sky was bleeding all over you

And you had your camera
And you had your felt tip
And you had some money
And you had everything you needed
The two angels came to Sodom in the evening
They saw you coming up the boulevard
The two angels came to Sodom in the evening
When the sun up in the sky was bleeding all over you
============================================================
Genesis 30:3
============================================================
For several days the visitors were here
We saw them turned down and we watched them disappear
Talked about the days they'd said were sure to come
Had a hard time believing

I remember seeing you, my tongue struck dumb
When you first came here from wherever it was you came from
The power in your voice
Your rough touch
You keeping care of me
Keeping watch

Open up the doors to the tent
Wonder where the good times went
I will do what you ask me to do
Because of how I feel about you

I saw his little face contract as his eyes met light
Try to imagine anything so bright
You only see it once and it steals into the dawn
And then it's gone forever

For several hours we lay there, last ones of our kind
Harder days coming, maybe
I don't mind
Sounds kind of dumb when I say it but it's true
I would do anything for you

Open up the promise of the day
And drive the dark things away
I will do what you ask me to do
Because of how I feel about you

House up in Clearlake
Where I used to live
Picked the lock on the front door
And felt it give

Touch nothing, move nothing, stand still
Keep my ears open for cars
See how the people here live now
Hope that they're better at it than I was

I used to live here
I used to live here
I used to live here
I used to live here

Pictures up on the mantle
Nobody I know
I stand by the tiny furnace
Where the long shadows grow

Living room to bedroom to kitchen
Familiar and warm
Hours we spent starving within these walls
Sounds of a distant storm

I used to live here
I used to live here
I used to live here
I used to live here

Fight through the ghosts in the hallway
Duck and weave
Stand by the door with my eyes closed
When it's time to leave

Steal home before sunset
Cover up my tracks
Drive home with old dreams of play in my mind
And the wind at my back

Break the lock on my own garden gate
When I get home after dark
Sit looking up at the stars outside
Like teeth in the mouth of a shark

I used to live here
I used to live here
I used to live here
I used to live here

Get Famous
============================================================
You were born for these flashing lights
You were born for these endless nights
You always knew sooner or later
You were destined for something greater
You took notes on what you had to do
To get the piece of the pie that belonged to you
You’ve been waiting for this ever since you were young
Be careful not to choke on your tongue

Get famous
You should be famous
Go on and get famous
I want you to be famous

Cold, grey world, all these obedient sheep
They act like they know, but they’re all sound asleep
Waiting for something to wake up to
Some nice juicy bone to chew
You arrive on the scene like a message from God
Listen to the people applaud
This is what you were born to do
Wesley Willis taught me how to write about you

Get famous
You should be famous
Go on and get famous
I want you to be famous

Light up the sky like a comet
Make yourself want to vomit
Shine like a cursed star
Show everybody exactly who you are

Get famous
You should be famous
Go on and get famous
I want you to be famous

Get Lonely (Song)
============================================================
I will rise up early and dress myself up nice
And I will leave the house and check the deadlock twice
And I will find a crowd and blend in for a minute
And I will try to find a little comfort in it

And I will get lonely
And gasp for air
And send your name off from my lips
Like a signal flare

And I will go downtown, stand in the shadows of the buildings
And button up my coat, trying to stay strong - spirit willing
And I will come back home, maybe call some friends
Maybe paint some pictures, it all depends

And I will get lonely
And gasp for air
And look up at the high windows
And see your face up there
============================================================
Get Your Mom Some Pie For Hanukah
============================================================
Won't you give your mom some pie for Hanukah?
Your mom would like some pie
With a nice sugar crust
And some cheese on the side
Please don't let another Hanukah go by
Without giving your mom a slice of pie

Is this the gratitude your mom gets?
You come around here with your little shiksa wife
But you can't be bothered to bring a pie with you
What's in your life?

Won't you put away your Tortoise remix records?
Get out your Steve & Eydie box set
Bring a lovely slice of pie down to mom's house right
now
And have the best Hanukah yet

Won't you give your mom some pie for Hanukah?
Your mom would like some pie
With a nice sugar crust
And some cheese on the side
Don't let another Hanukah go by
Without giving your mom a slice of pie

Hava nagila

Getting Into Knives (song)
============================================================
I hit the cul-de-sac on the spiritual path
Retraced my steps back home
But the house burned down before I got there
And I found myself alone

I tried to keep things in perspective
As I hunted down the perpetrator
Loaded up my toolkit with every hateful instrument
Now here we are thirty years later

I'm getting into knives
I'm getting into knives
I've been up and down the buffet several different times
I'm adjusting my focus, I'm getting into knives

I sought wisdom from the sages
Consulted with master tacticians
Met up with some guys who wouldn't tell me their last names
They specialized in non-conventional munitions

Stayed on the scent like a bloodhound
Followed the clues where they led
Taste of hot ashes on my tongue all day
I took my rifle with me to bed

But I'm getting into knives
I'm getting into knives
It's a gift to be simple, it's a gift to be free
I'm adjusting my focus, I'm getting into knives

Held to my vision all these days
While stray signals kept flooding the switchboard
Came all this way for hunger
May I be worthy of my reward

I stood at the door, and I listened
Rustled through my rucksack as quiet as I could
You can't give me back what you've taken
But you can give me something that's almost as good

I'm getting into knives
I am getting into knives
Behold, I stand at the door, and I knock, and then I knock twice
I've adjusted my focus, I'm getting into knives
============================================================
Ghost Force
============================================================
Ghost force.
Gotta dick and loins. No face.
Grew up in Brooklyn. Lives in Manhattan.
Ghost force with a penis.
Didn't go to college.
Ask can he buy you a drink.
Grew up in Brooklyn.
Has seen more than his share of women.
Wonders what's your favorite drink is.
Ghost force with a penis.
============================================================
Ghosts
============================================================
I went down the road today
Just in the old way
And a black dog hobbled past me
His tags jangled on his collar
It made me wish I was dead
It made me wish I was dead

And a familiar sun on me
Just like it would always be
Rocky soil, dry land
I knew it all like the back of my hand
It made me wish I was dead
It made me wish I was dead

Terrific view from here
Sky's clear
Sun's high
I let things lie
And I know what is and isn't mine
And it was good to get back to the sunshine
But five years is a long time
And I spent five years in Sweden dying for you
I spent five years in Sweden dying for you
============================================================
Glory of True Love
============================================================
Now the glory of true love
Is a wild and precious thing
It don't grow on old magnolias
Or blossom in the spring

No, the glory of true love
Is it will last your whole life through
Never will go out of fashion
Always will look good on you

You can climb the highest mountain
Touch the moon and stars above
But Old Faithful's just a fountain
Compared to the glory of true love

Long before I met you, darlin'
Lord, I thought I had it all
I could eat my lunch in London
And my dinner in St. Paul

Got some friends in Albuquerque
Where the governor calls me "Gov"
You can give 'em all to Goodwill
For the glory of true love

You can climb the highest mountain
Touch the moon and stars above
But Old Faithful's just a fountain
Compared to the glory of true love

Glory, glory, glory, glory
You can't never get enough
Time alone will tell the story
Of the glory of true love

You can climb the highest mountain
Touch the moon and stars above
But you know Old Faithful's just a fountain
Compared to the glory of true love
============================================================
Goblin Wizard in the Crawlspace of My Heart
============================================================
It shakes the ground with its groaning sound
The volume's off the chart
Goblin wizard in the crawlspace of my heart
============================================================
Goddess of Love
============================================================
You are my Goddess of Love.
You must be sent from above.
Because you make me smile just like a child.
When the day is dark, you wash the rain away.
My Goddess of Love.
You soothe my wild wild heart and modestly choose
to have a part in this act of my goddess of love.
============================================================
Going Back to California
============================================================
Parked by a mansion with an airstrip
Sun rising up so crisp and bright
Old dudes holed up in their bunkers
Chasing down the light

Faster than a speeding bullet
Smart as a whip
Dead in a parking lot in Leesburg
This is it

Going back to California
Going back to California

Burned up jewelry at the inquest
Cold now to the touch
Last time I ever saw him
He told me how I drink too much

Feel like I'm gonna crumble
What will become of us?
Take two weeks to think about it
Get right back on the bus

Feel so bad, so afraid
Of the road up ahead

Going back to California
Going back to California
============================================================
Going Invisible
============================================================
When I rose from a heavy sleep
I was stepping lightly
And I put on my gray suit
And the matching fedora
Ready to face the world
Fairly nearly ready
Came down the hallway
Looked in the mirror
I'm gonna break something
I'm gonna break something today
And sweep all the pieces away

And I stood before the mirror then
Like I was waiting for a phone call
Squinting like a lost traveler in a thick fog
But nothing clear came into view
Except for you
Just off in the distant horizon
Something hidden in your hand
I'm gonna break something
I'm gonna break something today
And sweep all the pieces away

And so I pulled my hat brim
Down over my eyes
And preened and posed and tried my
New self on for size

Then I was out the door
In the faint winter sunlight
Just a number in the crowd
Smiling at everyone
Ah but who'd smile back
At a face like that
I'm gonna break something
I'm gonna break something today
And sweep all the pieces away
============================================================
Going Invisible 2
============================================================
Look in the cellar where the cinders blaze
Sift through the shadows for days
Look in the corners, but you can't see me
You can't see me I'm free

I'm gonna burn it all down today, down today, okay
I'm gonna burn it all down today
And sweep all the ashes away

Count up the keepsakes in the cabinets
The keyboards and the chemistry sets
Look in the attic where the blinds are drawn
You won't find me I'm gone

I'm gonna burn it all down today, down today, okay
I'm gonna burn it all down today
And sweep all the ashes away

Etch an outline on your heart
I'm gonna blow the whole circus apart

Reckon the remnants when they land at last
The shattered aftermath of the blast
Look for me everywhere the burn marks form
Trying to find a place to keep warm

I'm gonna burn it all down today, down today, okay
I'm gonna burn it all down today
And sweep all the ashes away

I'm gonna burn it all down today, down today, okay
I'm gonna burn it all down today
And sweep all the ashes away

I'm gonna burn it all down today, down today, okay
I'm gonna burn it all down today
And sweep all the ashes away
============================================================
Going Through Pomona
============================================================
The lights are on in your room so tell me
Who's your friend?
And the lights are burning in the little house on east end
And I remembered who I was
And what I came here for
The moon was caught high in the branches of the sycamore

And on my neck I felt the cold wind
And it licked around my ears and it asked me to ask you, yeah
Who's your friend?
And the lights came down over Pomona, blazed again before your front door
The moon was caught high in the branches of the sycamore
============================================================
Going the Ways
============================================================
There's a special thing we do
When you play with me, and I play with you
We go thisaway
We go thataway
We go thisaway, we go thataway all day

It's a thing that you can try
If you feel your life is just passing you by
We go thisaway
We go thataway
We go thisaway, we go thataway all day

We may not always be going thisaway, it's true
But there's nothing that I like more than going thisaway
with you
And thataway, too

So if you're down and feeling blue
Why don't you do like Roman and his daddy do
And just go thisaway
Go thataway
We go thisaway
We go thataway
We go thisaway
We go thataway
We go thisaway
We go thataway

All day
============================================================
Going to Alaska
============================================================
The jacaranda are wet with color,
and the heat is a great paint brush, lending color to our lives,
and to the air, and to our faces; but I'm going to Alaska
where there's snow to suck the sound out from the air.

Up, yes, in the branches,
the purple blossoms, go pale at the edges;
there is meaning in the shifting of the sap, and I see in them traces
of last year, but then they hadn't grown so strong,
and their limbs were more like wires. Now they are cables.
thick and alive with alien electricity, and I am going to Alaska,
where you can go blind just by looking at the ground,
where fat is eaten by itself
just to keep the body warm.

Because from where we are now, it seems, really,
that everything is growing in a thousand different ways;
that the soil is soaked through with old blood and with relatives
who were buried here, or close to here, and they are giving rise
to what is happening. Or can you tell me otherwise?
I am going to Alaska, where the animals can kill you,
but they do so in silence, as though if no-one hears them,
then it really won't matter. I am going to Alaska.
They tell me that it's perfect for my purposes.
============================================================
Going to Bangor
============================================================
The ocean wind cold on our lips
The wild fern growing, sinking ships
All the signs are easy to read

In the morning you come my way
Your skin is pink, the sky is gray
There's fresh cranberries in your mouth
With thick red water dripping out
You expect me to believe everything you say
Well okay
============================================================
Going to Bogotá
============================================================
I know what I want
And I know what we need
When the first fruits of the harvest
Begin to blacken and bleed
And the purple fruit gives way when you press it
Even so slightly
And through the thatches behind the green leaves
We heard the fire-eyed macaw sing as evil as you please
And his little song
Is a very pretty song
But it's something I won't stand for

And as the sun rises over Colombia
I know we're done for

When the holes started forming in the tent
And you wondered out loud where the sunlight went
I had a mind to tell you
But I didn't want to hurt you
And if I knew how to form the words
I would ask you what you'd come for

But as the sun rises over Colombia
I know we're done for

Yeah as the sun rises over Colombia
I know we're done for
As the sun rises over Colombia
I know we're done for
============================================================
Going to Bolivia
============================================================
I cut myself a two-foot switch from some tropical hardwood nearby
And the sounds of a carnival drifted miraculously
Through the air from a thousand miles away
The monkeys jumped from tree to tree
It sent a deathly chill through me
In Bolivia

Wildcats I had never seen claimed places in my room
Animal noises rang through the thick brush like voices from the tomb
I saw the freshly-polished chrome
Gleaming in the midday sun
And I knew that you were coming home
To Bolivia
Hey hey
============================================================
Going to Brazil
============================================================
You've got something magic in your eyes
You don't have to say you're sorry
You've got a sentence waiting on your tongue
Pronounce it now

I'm going where the air is hot
Where they speak a language sorta like one I can speak
I'm going to South America
Don't wait up for me

You've got what I need but I can't have it
That's alright
You're everything I want and I can't touch you
Let me touch you anyhow

I'm going where the air is hot
Where they speak a language sorta like one I can speak
Yeah I am going to South America
Don't wait up for me

I've got what you want but that's enough of that
That'll be enough of that for now
It's gonna clear-cut twenty thousand acres
When I touch your hair

I'm going where the air is hot
Where they speak a language sorta like one I can speak
Yeah, I am going to South America
Don't wait up for me

I'm going to where the air is hot
Where they speak a language sorta like one I can speak
Yeah, I am going to South America
Don't wait up for me
============================================================
Going to Bridlington
============================================================
Stopped by for the coffee and cake that you promised
Saw your porch light on
Saw your wirehaired terrier lazing on the lawn
Came right in through the front door
Went right down the main hall
Turned right into the kitchen
There you were alright
The moon was rising over Bridlington
And you had blood all over your hands
Someone was singing in the yard next door
And you had blood all over your hands

Sat down on the kitchen floor
Looked up at you
Saw you smoothing down your skirt around your thighs
Wondered what good that was supposed to do
And I saw you pull your hair back
Saw you messing with your earrings
Saw you trying to smile
Hey you don't have to smile for me
The moon was rising over Bridlington
And you had blood all over your hands
Something was cracking in the rafters of our house
And you had blood all over your hands
The moon was rising over Bridlington
The moon was rising over Bridlington
The moon was rising
============================================================
Going to Bristol
============================================================
I looked you up and down
I liked everything I saw
From the fragile outline of your hips
To the trembling movements in your jaw
But when the coffee cup shattered on the kitchen floor
You said that you couldn't take it anymore
I knew you were leaving
I knew you were going to Bristol

I watched you pack your bags
Saw you head up to the door
But when the key broke off in the deadbolt lock
Said that you couldn't take it anymore
That was the second time you said that in one day
Why don't you just sit still
It's going to be okay
Going to Bristol
Going to Bristol
Going to Bristol
Going to Bristol
============================================================
Going to Buffalo
============================================================
Lay down just a little while
Honey lemon-chamomile
Very soon the plane's coming in

One hour worth of quicksand
The glass warm against your hand
Very soon the airplane will take me away

I will nuzzle up against you and then
I will never see you again
Fires burning
The world's turning around

Words that lose their meanings
And then swell up like balloons
Very soon the taxi will come
All the lies you told me can no longer hold me
Very soon the taxi will take me away

I will forget how you've done me wrong
How you've strung me along
Fires burning
Learning to breathe
============================================================
Going to California
============================================================
The bows hang low
And I know
Why
The apple blossoms are dry
No rainfall
No rain this year
No rain at all
No rain anywhere near here

Skin cracking
The skies are clear
There's no turning back now
But there's no water here

The flash bulb pops
But those are some sad lookin' crops
See?
That's the useless tractor
And over there that's me
Standing on dry land
Reaping the dividends
Under a cloudless sky
Smiling at the camera lens

Skin cracking
The skies are clear
There's no turning back now
But there's no water here

Skin cracking
The skies are clear
There's no turning back now
But there's no water here
============================================================
Going to Chino
============================================================
I'd like to say hello
To all our friends from Chino
To the people of Chino, hello
I'd like to say hello
To all our friends from Chino
To the people of Chino, hello

I know how hard it is down in Chino
I know how you struggle just to get by
I know they got farm fresh eggs down in Chino
And tract homes reasonably priced

I'd like to say hello
To all our friends from Chino
To the people from Chino, hello
I'd like to say hello
To all our friends from Chino
To the people from Chino, hello

Convenient access to the 60 freeway
Accredited medical care down at Chino Valley Hospital
A unified school system, the likes of which you won't find elsewhere
And friendly people

I would like to say hello
To all our friends from Chino
To the people from Chino, hello
I'd just like to say hello
To all our friends from Chino
To the people from Chino
Hello
============================================================
Going to Cleveland
============================================================
We both know you're leaving
You just don't want to say it yet
'Cause you don't want to hurt my feelings
So you gnaw your little holes in the net

And you torture me with those big eyes
And you punish me with pity
But I'm going to Cleveland

You say you wanted to strike first
Because one of us was leaving
That's what you say
But I've always been real fond of you
So I never would've treated you this way

And you torture me with those big eyes
And you punish me with pity
But I'm going to Cleveland

I hear the Cuyahoga calling, now I know
What I was born for
And you say "Hey John, where are you going?"
But that's not my name anymore

And you torture me with those big eyes
And you punish me with pity
But I'm going to Cleveland
============================================================
Going to Dade County
============================================================
When the rainbows disappeared from the skies of northern Florida
Because the rain had gone away
And I looked out on the front lawn and I saw you there
It was 6:31 AM on a Saturday
And you morphed into a housecat
And you all think I'm making this part up
But you are wrong

And the wind came through the window
And it my licked at my face
And I heard the sound of about a thousand tomcats
Squalling up from all over the place
And you all think I'm crazy
Or trying to amuse myself by telling cute stories
Or telling cute stories to amuse other people with
But you are wrong
Going to Dade County
============================================================
Going to Dallas
============================================================
Nobody's ever gonna pour
Plaster in my tracks
My exit will be clean
When I vanish from the scene
You won't find any thumbprints
To dust your powder into
Just mute donkeys still as statues
In each saloon I've been through

Going to Dallas
As far as anybody knows
Maybe Montana
Depending on the way the wind blows

No blinking red light on the line tonight
Or any night out in the future
Kiss the people you hold dear
Forget that I was ever here
If world should reach you from the field
Be cool
Try not to talk out of school
Make them beat it out of you if they want it
Live like a pack mule

Going to Dallas
As far as anyone's concerned
Maybe Montana
Depending on the way the roads turn

And if they steer me wrong
I'm just going to play along
Remember this when the time comes
Try to let it soften the blow

Let me go to no haven anyone would yearn for
Burn a hole in something for me
Turn around and let me go free

Going to Dallas
In the morning when the wind is fair
Maybe Montana
If I've got enough gas to get there
============================================================
Going to Federal Prison
============================================================
One magic night you come to me [the rest of a long opening line
You couldn't pick my face out of a lineup
I know you though

I grab hold of your hand
Bring it up to my mouth
We're gonna run out of land
We're gonna run out of land
If we keep heading south
============================================================
Going to France
============================================================
You say it's too cold over there anyway
It's far too cold
And I'm going to France
And I'm taking you with me

Wild berries, wild sheep
You know you want to see them
Well I'm going to France
And I'm taking you with me

We always said one day we were going there
Well, I don't know about you
But I keep my promises
And I'm going to France
And I'm taking you with me
============================================================
Going to Georgia
============================================================
The most remarkable thing about coming home to you is the feeling of being in motion again
It's the most extraordinary thing in the world

I have two big hands and a heart pumping blood and a 1967 Colt .45 with a busted safety catch
The world shines as I cross the Macon county line
Going to Georgia

The most remarkable thing about you standing in the doorway is that it's you
And that you're standing in the doorway
And you smile as you ease the gun from my hand and I’m frozen with joy right where I stand
The world throws its light underneath your hair
Forty miles from Atlanta, this is nowhere
Going to Georgia
============================================================
Going to Hungary
============================================================
We touched down in Budapest
Headed straight for the motel room and got undressed
We had not slept for three or four days
We slipped underneath the covers
It felt okay

About twelve hours later
The sun came out to play
I felt it on my eyelids
I pushed your hair away

You put on your old gloves
You put on your new skirt
I put on my cowboy boots
I slipped on my yellow shirt
We headed out, sweat drying on our bodies
And I got all sentimental
We were heading straight to hell
In a Lincoln Continental
============================================================
Going to Jamaica
============================================================
I saw the last of the brightly colored birds
Check out and make for the other world
And you ask me how much longer we have to stay here
But I'm not at liberty to say

And what flowers there were around Kingston are blue
I ripped them up from the dry soil and draped them over you

We saw the last of the bright birds coming home
I saw you address them through your megaphone
And you asked me when we were leaving
Well, it's any day now

And what flowers there were around Trenchtown were red
I stole them from the hands of children
I braided them around your head
============================================================
Going to Japan
============================================================
There's a north wind coming in
And there's a west wind coming in
And there's an east wind coming in
And there's a strong wind blowing in from the south
And there's a sweet metallic taste in my mouth
There's a dead feeling lingering over the land

And there's a one-way ticket in my hot little hand
And I'm kissing your eyelids and I'm going to Japan

There's life and liberty on my tongue
And there's a dead silence where the wind-chimes hung
And on some mountain somewhere in the world it's snowing
But here in the fields there's not a thing growing
Maybe next year, you know, there is no way of knowing
There's wind coming in from all directions
There's a coat on my shoulders, midnight connections

And I'm kissing you and leaving you behind in the sand
I'm holding you a while then I'm going to Japan
============================================================
Going to Kansas
============================================================
You were all were dressed in green
Clouds bounced against the edges of the sky
You had the prettiest hair I'd ever seen
We saw the world passing by

There was an ocean's droning
Though we were nowhere near the shore
We heard each other giggling and moaning
Then we couldn't hear each other any more yeah

When my head was resting on your breastbone
I could hear your beating heart
24 hours later you had left me completely alone
I heard the whole world come apart

And you were all dressed in green
Rising in the sky was an unfamiliar star
You know, you know what I mean
Yeah I remember who you are
============================================================
Going to Kirby Sigston
============================================================
We boarded up the windows
And we sealed the door shut
And we let the special chicken
Build a nest right by the window
Your face was glowing
The heat was strong
We ate cold black eggs all day long
In the winter when the wind kicked up

I saw your body moving
Through the incandescent light
You were dancing by yourself there
Your sweater hugged your shoulders and it was alright
We plucked sugar crystals from the cold English air
I had a present for you hidden somewhere
In the winter when the wind kicked up
============================================================
Going to Lebanon
============================================================
Saw your arms hanging at your side
Nowhere to run to, baby, nowhere to hide
Saw you moving real slow
Nowhere to run to, nowhere to go
I heard the wind blow
I saw your sash come untied
Blue water, white sky

Up in the cedars, we were too far away
For the radio to tell us the time of day
But there was moisture in the air
I heard the city call
They can go on burning
To hell with them all
Your liquid movements
The water rushing by
Blue water, white sky

World's surface was as smooth as glass
And they saw the hour coming and they didn't let it pass
I heard you say my name twice through your teeth
I saw you coming down to me, I was underneath
It's been coming for some time
You close your eyes
Blue water, white sky

I heard the wind blow
I saw your sash come untied
Blue water, white sky
============================================================
Going to Lebanon 2
============================================================
We came down to the shore
Always some desperate people there
Anywhere people congregate for pleasure
They'll go hunting for treasure
Come one, come all, fortune-seeking brothers
Pick up the faint, faint scent
Of the faith of our fathers
Their names were known once to me
I hear them sometimes on the song of the sea

Take note of what will be gone
In the blink of an eye
The blue, blue water
The bone-white sky

You can set your watch by these guys
We will be high on the highway
Before they've even opened their eyes
Picture them scouring the sanctuary
Looking for gold
It never gets old

But there is no gold and there is no silver
And the South takes what the North delivers
Reverse the circuit sometimes
Every couple seasons
Remember our grandfathers
Whenever we need a reason

Take note of what will be gone
In the blink of an eye
The blue, blue water
The bone-white sky, yeah
============================================================
Going to Lubbock
============================================================
He drove north out of Dallas on a Tuesday afternoon
The summer wind was sweet in his mouth
As the engine whistled a solitary tune
Ran out of gas in the middle of nowhere
Among the rocks and the tumbleweeds and the dust
He popped the trunk and he pulled out the shovel
And punched the dull blade through the earth's tough crust

When he dug up the human skull that was bigger than a basketball
He took one step back
He took one step back
Into the sunlight

He stood there by the roadside
Underneath the clear blue sky
And ancient stories ran through his mind
As the certain detail caught his eye
There was a pronounced depression
Along the skull's occipital bone
Space burned in the dry June sun
And his forehead dripped like an ice cream cone
He laid the skull down gently in the backseat
And in his mouth the summer wind was sweet

He took one step back
He took one step back
Into the sunlight
============================================================
Going to Maine
============================================================
You and me are in a lot of trouble
And somebody's gonna burst our bubble
Your husband
My wife
My marriage
Your life

Let's go to Maine out on the East Coast
Let's go to Maine right now
Let's beat the retreat
Let's hop on the plane
Let's get out of here
Let's go to Maine

Someone knows what's going on
Someone knows, and someone's gonna tell
Someone's gonna wrap us up in Styrofoam and paper
And mail us flat-rate right down to Hell

Let's go to Maine out on the East Coast
Let's go to Maine right now
Let's beat the retreat
Let's hop on the plane
Let's get out of here
Let's go to Maine

Let's go to Maine out on the East Coast
Let's go to Maine right now
Let's beat the retreat
Let's hop on the plane
Let's get out of here
Let's go to Maine
============================================================
Going to Malibu
============================================================
When we meet on neutral ground
I can't believe how good you look
And the thoughts that race around my mind
Could fill a long unreadable book and

I can hear the waves
I could sense the continent eroding
You say you know why I called you here
But you couldn't have any way of knowing, so

That's not true
That's a mean thing to say
That's a damnable lie
That's a damnable lie

Looking at you, and I don't know
What it is I see
But I know you're changing
Almost indetectably

And I see a ship off the shore
And I imagine it sinking
And you smile and you say that you know
What it is that I'm thinking

That's not true
That's a rotten thing to say
That's a damnable lie
That's a damnable lie
============================================================
Going to Marrakesh
============================================================
The fog is lifting from the water
The bells are sounding on the boats
And our love is a monster, plain and simple
Though you weight it down with stones to try to drown it
It floats
It floats

The day of reckoning is coming
Faster than anyone here realizes
And our love is like Jesus, but worse
Though you seal the cave up where you've lain its body
It rises
It rises

I keep waiting for our love to die
The machines by its bed dim and flicker but it won't stay dead
And it perks up when the nurses bring its medication by

I wish our love could go the way of all flesh
But it's not right, and it's not nice
To try and kill the same thing twice
Would you pack your things
We are going to Marrakesh
============================================================
Going to Maryland
============================================================
Water's real cool and the water's real sweet
Here's hoping that no points repeat
Because I bet against the chances that you'd ever be mine
Laid everything down on the don't pass line

And it's a stupid trick of fortune anyway
But the lights are bright tonight
And your eyes shine tonight on Chesapeake Bay

Walk through the water and our feet get wet
And on the darkening water I see your silhouette
Five dollars says that it's gone in a minute
Five dollars says that your heart goes with it

It's a stupid trick of fortune anyway
But the lights are bright tonight
And your eyes shine tonight on Chesapeake Bay
============================================================
Going to Mexico
============================================================
I saw you at your window
I saw you in the sun
I saw you in the window looking out

I reached my hand in there
Then I touched your hair
And felt myself burn in the morning

And the chickens were screaming
Black dog at my heels
And the bluejays were coughing up in the trees

I'd forgotten my name
I felt kind of ashamed
And felt myself burn in the morning

I saw you at your window
At the beginning of summer
And invisible stars sent their heat down

I imagined your touch
It was almost too much
Burned like a bonfire in the morning
============================================================
Going to Miami
============================================================
Picture things as they were meant to be
Picture the sofa and you and me
Picture the numbers of the clock on the wall
Remember how it told us nothing at all
Picture the both of us, stone drunk
Remember skin against skin and all that junk
Feel the rhythm. Look me in the eye
Imagine the bright pink color of the sky

Where we're going, it's always warm
And nobody knows you
Miami

Painted pictures with all your friends
We may never see them again
Just in case our paths don't cross
Get addresses and numbers easy to get lost
In the sweltering, almost tropical heat
With the clear blue water beneath our feet
Almost immutable to understand
And then the sun goes blind and then I touch your hand

Where we're going, it's always warm
And nobody knows you
Miami
============================================================
Going to Michigan
============================================================
As the car rolled north towards Michigan you complained
That all I like to listen to is Gary Numan and the Tubeway Army
Well maybe that's true
But what about you
And the Blue Cheer comprehensive retrospective box set
That's pretty annoying too

The wing window flew open
The air was thin
I heard you say so and I heard the
Shadings of meaning therein
And your fingers touched mine
And that supersonic whine began near the back of my skull
And the white rose burned
You know exactly what I mean about the burning white rose, yes you do
Yes you do
============================================================
Going to Monaco
============================================================
Sea gobbles up the full sun
And I look at you and I know you're the one
The one I used to know something about
And I try to say what it was but the words won't come out
And you ask me to hold you
That's the devil's work

You show your palms and I see they're empty
And I'd check them twice if you'd let me
But you wouldn't do that now would you?
I didn't think so
And you ask me to hold you
That's the devil's work

We stand on the sand and we watch the world turn
And we stand on the sand and we watch the water burn
And we stand on the sand six inches from one another
And the sands burn and blow but neither one of us runs for cover
And you ask me to hold you
That's the devil's work
And you ask me to hold you
But that's the devil's work
============================================================
Going to Morocco
============================================================
There's no wolves around here
There's no wolves around here
Have a drink
Drink your fill
From the tap
From the still
If you won't, I will
But there are no wolves around here

There's no reason to cry
There's no reason to cry
You can sit down for a while
Relax
Smile
But don't touch that dial
'Cause there is no reason to cry

There's a gutteral stop in my throat
There's a gutteral stop in my throat
The desert stretches far and wide
Sands blow
Grains collide
I'm changing inside
And there's a gutteral stop
In my throat
============================================================
Going to Niles
============================================================
Things are bad at home
Getting chased out of town
Find a couple friends
Take the expressway on down
Going to Niles
Going to Niles

Take Chicago to Milwaukee
Head up quite a ways
Find myself a leaning tower
Visit every day
Going to Niles
Going to Niles

I said I’m going back to Niles
Gotta get there somehow
Headed to the White Horse Inn
It's an Econolodge now
Going to Niles
Going to Niles
Going straight to Niles
============================================================
Going to Norwalk
============================================================
At one thirty on a Thursday night
I saw a pair of raccoons heading to the gutter
They stopped at the storm drain
Their tails hung down and out of sight
They looked up at me
Their eyes were shining
I thought of you

and I can't stand
The way the moon expands and fills out
The corners of the California sky
I can't stand it

The old buildings stood tall against the sky
The windows had old sheets hanging over them doubling as curtains
And the silhouettes moving in the bright lights behind the curtains
Looked like you
I stopped moving momentarily

The world will
Stand still on nights like these
Without any kind of warning
And I can't stand it
============================================================
Going to Palestine
============================================================
That woman set herself on fire
They said it on the radio
They said she lit up the skies of Palestine
I could not stand to hear them say so
I saw the stars come out
I saw the oranges on the trees

Later on they played some Caribbean song
Man they sure know how to pick 'em
The rich voice burning like a fuse
The syncopated rhythm
I saw the stars come out
I saw the oranges cracking open
I saw you standing there
Orange blossom in your hair
Going to Palestine
Going to Palestine
============================================================
Going to Port Washington
============================================================
The trees were all decked out in their best fall colors
There was a snap in the air
When you eased down the window
And the New York sun brought out the highlights in your hair
And gently, gently
The constellations aligned
And as we crossed over the Throgs Neck Bridge I had
Something on my mind

When we rolled down the street
In the cool of the morning
I could feel the new day dawn
And somebody'd gone and turned the waterworks on
And slowly, surely
I saw the whole story unwind
I had never loved anyone like I loved you and I had
Something on my mind
============================================================
Going to Queens
============================================================
the ghostly sing-song
of the children playing double-dutch.
I felt the wind come through the window
I felt it turn around and switch back.
in the second story room
in Jamaica Queens
your hair was dripping wet.
your skin was clean.
and the children skipping rope
tripled their speed
you were all I'd ever wanted
you were all I'd ever need.
in New York City
in the middle of July
the air was heavy and wet
the air was heavy, your body was heavy on mine.
I will know who you are yet.
I will know who you are yet.
============================================================
Going to Reykjavik
============================================================
I've been drinking that coffee you sent me from Thailand
I've been watching the lamps burn
I've been listening to the wind chime
I've been waiting my turn

And I'm coming to you
I'm coming to you
I am coming to you

I heated the milk until it boiled and I drank it down
I stepped outside and I checked my reflection in the rain
There were voices on the wind
Winter coming on in
And I made myself up again, brand new

And I am broken and I am tired
And I'm coming to you
With my mouth dripping
============================================================
Going to San Diego
============================================================
Long rain, it must be June again
Warm air, and it's so warm down there
I'm coming soon, open the blinds
Your friends all tell me that you've lost your mind
I don't believe them

The seashore, I don't want to see it anymore
The bus runs smoothly
The back window's open and the burning air cools me
Hold your breath
Your friends all swear you're one step away from death
I don't believe them

Mmmm, here it comes
My head is throbbing and my hands are numb
It's you
What was I thinking
What should I do
Your eyes are open and it's more than I can take
My friends all told me I was making a mistake
I don't believe them
============================================================
Going to Santiago
============================================================
Big birds in the trees
Car's locked and I've lost my keys
Crashing sounds of the waterfall
And a statue of Jesus two hundred feet tall

Three thousand miles from the port in California
And three little feet from falling off the earth
And the shadow of a mountain
Should cast a shadow
And the snow underfoot is soft and yielding

La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la

Look at those birds
I'd say something about them but I've lost the words
They're laughing and they're watching me
And the radiator's boiling for no reason

Wild cattle crossing as it strikes their fancy
And a handful of money which does me no good
And a pocketful of medicine to abuse myself with
And a photograph of someone stapled to my shirtsleeve

La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la
============================================================
Going to Scotland
============================================================
There was a barn owl trapped in the rafters
The ground underneath us was wet and cold
We heard the owl thrashing about
Trying desparately to get out
We stood outside and watched the night unfold

We watched the sun go down on Scotland
And I watched the moon come up over you
When a pack of dogs went silently past us
We knew we'd been given fair warning
But that was the only thing we knew

And you threw all your luggage out onto the water
And I tore the shirt away from my back
The cold came on with a new-found intensity
And you pressed your warm body against me
And I loved you so much it was making me sick

We watched the sun go down on Scotland
We were glad that we'd left Oklahoma behind
I took your hips in my hands and I threw you down
To the new-found rich brown deep wet ground
Had a vision of you burning on my mind

We watched the sun go down on Scotland
And I watched the moon come up over you
When a pack of dogs went silently past us
We knew we'd been given fair warning
But that was the only thing we knew
============================================================
Going to Some Damned English City
============================================================
Your skirt was red and flowing
Your blouse was blue
On the night I locked eyes with you
It seemed to me like I hadn't seen your eyes since last December

My shredding muscles
My popping joints
I saw the pupils of your eyes by firelight shrinking down to pinpoints
You were poking at the embers
There's a cold wind coming off the ocean
There's a cold wind coming off the ocean

I wet my finger with my tongue and pressed it in the ashes
Rubbed it up against your perfect eyelashes
You said something really important
Something pretty seems to have slipped my mind
Walls were freezing, so was the floor
I didn't want to hurt you anymore
You had a sad, sad, friend in front of you
That dying fire behind
There was a cold wind coming off the ocean
There was a cold wind coming off the ocean
============================================================
Going to Spain
============================================================
It's heaven up here
But it's heaven down there
And you're gonna leave me
Now I don't care

It's heaven outside
But it's heaven indoors
Well go on and leave me
I don't care any more

I hear the airplane coming
I hear the airplane coming
I hear the airplane coming now
It can't touch me

I see you going up the little stair
Go on and board the plane
I don't care I-

I see you hold his hand
I see you wave good-bye
I don't know you anymore
So I'm not going to cry now

I see the airplane coming
I feel the airplane coming
I hear the airplane coming now
It can't touch me
============================================================
Going to Spirit Lake
============================================================
Why did you say what you said when the hummingbird vanished from sight
In the sudden swelling heat of the dark October night
You were laughing and your eyes were alive
And I knew that the moment had finally arrived
And I reached out through the air for your hand and held on tight
You said the right thing
You fixed everything
As the stars formed a canopy over Spirit Lake
You said what you said
And the stars grew softer overhead
I was on fire
I was on fire for you
============================================================
Going to Tennessee
============================================================
Baseball season will be starting soon
But we have no baseball team here
I've got a house right on the river
I can see Arkansas from where I am

The dogs are gathering
And the birds are chattering
And the sun is setting on Memphis
And the sun is setting on Memphis

Medicine bottle collection on the windowsill
Shakes when the cars go past on interstate fifty-five
You are standing above me
You've washed your face with that apricot scrub again
I'm glad I am alive
And your skin is warming up
And my skin is warming up
And the sun is setting on Memphis
And the sun is setting on Memphis
============================================================
Going to Utrecht
============================================================
In the morning I looked down
Through the third story window overlooking town
Across the water somewhere, you were sleeping over there
I couldn't believe it, I couldn't believe it
Not if I saw it with my own eyes
With my own eyes
With my own eyes
With my own eyes
With my own eyes

In the morning I looked down
Through the third story window overlooking town
And I saw you, and I know you saw me too
I couldn't believe it, I couldn't believe it
Not if I saw it with my own eyes
With my own eyes
With my own eyes
With my own eyes
With my own eyes
============================================================
Going to Wisconsin
============================================================
There was the sound of a lake boiling over
On that day
Everyone said just to sit still
But the thickening air got in my way

So the hook's been baited now
Yeah the cheese is on the water
Yeah the water's been cleansed of all impurities
But now it really doesn't matter
Let's go, let's go

Wisconsin bound
Wisconsin bound
Wisconsin bound, yeah
Wisconsin bound

The bottom of the boat was a hotplate come alive
But the boat wasn't real, and this is how I feel
You don't know where you are until you arrive
And the frogs sang out from the distant banks
And you say you need me in California
But no thanks

Wisconsin bound
Wisconsin bound
Wisconsin bound
Yeah, Wisconsin bound
Let's go
============================================================
Gojam Province 1968
============================================================
Running like a band of angry schoolboys
Up and down the well-lit streets today
Bashing in the heads of tax collectors
And anybody else who's in our way

Bathing in the sunlight that's our birthright
Waiting for someone to set the scene
The last time he came to town, a few stray coins came raining down
We scrambled in the dirt for them like ants around the queen

We take aim at the dawning day
And we shoot
Starving to death, starving to death
For the low hanging fruit

Then all at once, here comes the motorcade
Slow and steady down the beaten track
And as we're bashing out the windows of the limo
We notice there's nobody in the back

And the helicopter lands atop the palace
The royal guard assembles at the gate
The country's gonna burn and we'll still have to wait our turn
Last among contenders of the super-featherweights

We take aim at the dawning day
And we shoot
Starving to death, starving to death
For the low hanging fruit
============================================================
Golden Boy
============================================================
You must try to lead a good life
You must do unto others as you would have them do
So that when you die you'll find Golden Boy peanuts
Waiting in the afterlife for you

There are no Pan-Asian supermarkets down in hell
So you can't buy Golden Boy peanuts
There are no Pan-Asian supermarkets down in hell
So you can't buy Golden Boy peanuts, yeah

If thine enemy oppresseth you
You must let him oppress you some more
So that when you go shopping in paradise
You'll find those magnificent peanuts from Singapore
With the drawing of the young Chinese farmer
The eastern sun behind him smiling at you from the shelves
If we want to spend eternity in happiness
Well, we're gonna have watch ourselves

You must give to the March of Dimes
You must be on guard against wickedness at all times
And you will find that your efforts have brought you great joy
When your spirit is munching on that Golden Boy

There are no Pan-Asian supermarkets down in hell
So you can't buy Golden Boy peanuts there
But the streets of heaven are lined with shells
And there's billboards of the Golden Boy everywhere
There are no Pan-Asian supermarkets down in hell
So you can't buy Golden Boy peanuts
There are no Pan-Asian supermarkets down in hell
So you can't buy Golden Boy peanuts
Go!
============================================================
Golden Jackal Song
============================================================
Well I swung through town
Shining like a new quarter
Felt something sharp rise up within me when I
Crossed the border
Stopped at the gas station payphone
I let my fingers fly
The wicked impulses were dying but I
Couldn't let them die

And we were over at your place, singing about the old times
No one had anything to prove
I ate so much carrion that I could not move
I was bloated

When I saw your kitchen
Glistening like the old country
All your cups and glasses
Lined up in front of me
And I stopped at the faucet for a minute
Waited 'til you came in to see what was wrong
Your fingers brushed my ribs playfully
And I played along

And you had your tongue in my mouth
Your eyes glistening in the light
I ate rich raw carrion 'til I couldn't think right
I was full
============================================================
Gone to Stay
============================================================
She's left again, left me alone.
I took it again, took it on the chin.
Then I stopped, she's gone again.
But, this time, she's gone to stay.
============================================================
Good Morning to All Vultures
============================================================
Good morning to all vultures
High up in the trees
Good morning to all vultures
Of high and low degrees
Good morning to all vultures
Near and far
In distant lands across the sea or
Right here where we are

Good morning to all vultures
Atop the temple gate
Good morning sleepy vulture
Trying to fly straight
Good morning to the vulture
With the great big beak
We hope today you find
The carrion you seek

It's hard sometimes to be a vulture today
And so we sing "good morning"
Just to start you on your way

Good morning to all vultures
High above this town
Don't let anybody
Try to bring you down
Circle around the cemetery
Way up high
Anyone would be proud to know
So much of the sky
============================================================
Goodbye, Charlie
============================================================
Goodbye, Charlie.
My uncle.
Your god is Guthrie at the piano.
Sudden Death.
Amazing Grays.
Who are these people?
Not your friends, my uncle.
It's death, is dead.
No Goodbye.
============================================================
Goodbye White Chapel
============================================================
I came into the harbor at Boston
Young and wild and free
And I made my way down the countryside.
What's become of me?
Savannah, Georgia
Savannah, Georgia
Savannah, Georgia opened up her arms.
Savannah, Georgia
Savannah, Georgia
Savannah, Georgia opened her arms up wide.

The corn was tall
The corn was tall
The corn was tall.
The wind was hard
The wind was hard
The wind was hard.

Savannah, Georgia
Savannah, Georgia
Savannah, Georgia opened up her arms.
Savannah, Georgia
Savannah, Georgia
Savannah, Georgia opened her arms up wide.

When i was creeping
When i was creeping
When i was creeping
Robert E. Lee broke his musket on his knee
And a thousand pieces shattered on the ground
But he got up quick
He gathered up his men
And from his lips there came an awful sound.
Savannah, Georgia
Savannah, Georgia
Savannah, Georgia opened up her arms.
Savannah, Georgia
Savannah, Georgia
Savannah, Georgia opened her arms up wide.
============================================================
Gravedigger
============================================================
The pumpkins grew in neat rows
We waltzed toward the center of the field
Steady as she goes
And blue heavens built wishing wells
Brightening the patch
Fattening the pumpkins in their perfect orange shells
We turned right by the smooth orange big one
The wrong way

We tapped the pumpkins with our thumbs
And you know how you wait a year or so for something, nothing comes
It was like that
Empty bottles washed clean by rain
Nothing to lose here
No reason to complain
We turned right by the smooth orange fat one
The wrong way

Tell me a secret
What does it matter
Override the red clouds
Hanging on the otherwise clear sky
And then little raindrops like tiny knives
And I turned to you and the field came alive
We took a smooth turn around the fattest pumpkin they had
The wrong way
============================================================
Greasepaint Friday
============================================================
white skies like doorways and my bright eyes
tight skin shining now
the words that hang like new fat plums
heavy on the bow
the nectar which can be distilled
from windows in the house
it takes a hand which knows how to crush
each then into a now

the new moon well it looked new to me
air hanging heavy and full
which shines under the right conditions
and the near magnetic pull
the peace that makes the names get blurred
i choose my words so careful
when i get to the dragon gate
i sing it loud and mournful

lamb of god you take away the sins of the world
have mercy on us
lamb of god you take away the sins of the world
have mercy on us
============================================================
Great Pirates
============================================================
On the morning when I stop looking back
I'll be up to see the sunrise in deep bruised black
And bright blood red, and pale desert rose
And several other colors like those

Great pirates testing the waves
Great pirates testing the waves

Everybody gone from here
May you all emerge free and clear
And may you do some good where you go
High in the hands of the crosswinds,
or in the arms of the undertow

Great pirates testing the waves
Great pirates testing the waves

And calling the roll - let's see:
Just me
And checking the rigging before
Heading off to war

Peach rose black sky up early
Carry what I need to carry
Bury what I have to bury
Dancing, whistling, singing past the cemetery

Great pirates testing the waves
Great pirates testing the waves
============================================================
Green Olives
============================================================
The little lemon blossoms
In perfect animation
And your tangerine perfume
Tasted like salvation
Green olives on the tree
Falling down on me
And you coming through the light rain
Effortlessly

And will we then arrive
At the house justly appointed
To find you in your splendor
Righteous and anointed
Green olives on the tree
Falling down on me
And you coming through the light rain
Effortlessly
============================================================
Grendel's Mother
============================================================
The cave mouth shines
By pure force of will
I look down on the world
From the top of this lonesome hill
And you can run, and run some more
From here all the way to Singapore
But I will carry you home in my teeth

In the great hall you drink red wine
You chew meat off the bone
I beat down the new path to the castle
I come naked and alone
I laid my son on the bier, I burned the wreath
Fire overhead, water underneath
You can stand up or you can run
You and I both know what you've done
And I will carry you home
I will carry you home
I will carry you home in my teeth
============================================================
Ground Level
============================================================
You can make out all the exits
From a static position
One quick walkaround will give you
All the relevant information
Never going to break my neck
Falling downstairs
Tan and mustard-yellow I-beam
Visible from the air

Tall space heater
Down the main hallway
Blue pilot light
Hissing all night

We sleep light in the shadow of the cloverleaf

You can light a cigarette
Against the cooktop if you need to
Feel the heat against your forehead
Let it bleed through
You're never going to get by
On three hours' sleep a night
Unless you absolutely have to
And then you get by all right

Move in silence
If you can't stay still
Nobody sees your face
Through the security grille

We sleep light in the shadow of the cloverleaf
============================================================
Guys on Every Corner
============================================================
From the front door to the drugstore
From the drugstore to the bakery
From the loading dock to the chimes of the city clock
They're about to make their play for me

But I will rise 'cause I got guys
Guys on every corner

With your tabloid stars and your unmarked cars
With your special forces and your inside sources
With your radar fields and your riot shields
And heavy horses

I'm coming to swat you down like flies
'Cause I got guys
Guys on every corner

They don't look so special
T-shirts and tennis shoes
Blank expressions
A couple of Chicago guys
A robust East Bay delegation

From the far ends of the earth
They have loosely gathered
To stand in doorways making small talk
About the weather
They look like nothing
They look like your neighbors
You won't remember their faces later

Run like rats, look to the skies
'Cause I got guys
Guys on every corner
============================================================
Hail St. Sebastian
============================================================
It gets harder to keep trying to hold on
Watch our hopes take wing
Wave at them when they're gone
Plunge like suicides from rooftops
Break our ankles when we land
And bless the arrows
That strike us where we stand

If it doesn't crush me
It's alright
If it doesn't break me
It's alright
All the petty demons trying to break me in two
I was born stronger than any of you
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright

It gets complicated
When they come in for their counterattack
Everybody hates a victim
Who won't stop fighting back
Sprayed blood in their faces
Play for keeps
And bless the brave assassins
Who strike us while we sleep

If it doesn't crush me
It's alright
If it doesn't break me
It's alright
All the petty demons trying to break me in two
I was born stronger than any of you
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright

Hair Match
============================================================
You'll be maybe lunging for the bad guy’s hip
No one anticipates the sunset flip
The referee and your opponent will hold you there
And we're gonna bring in a folding chair

We'll stipulate that there will be no cameras filming
But of course there will be several in the building
And if by chance somebody hits "record"
And stands real still somewhere back behind the soundboard

Cheap electric razor from the Thrifty down the street
Two guys down around your ankles so you'll stay put in your seat
Buzzing razor held aloft and just about to strike
I loved you before I even ever knew what love was like

Some people leave before it's over, but most of them stay
Some hide behind their programs, some turn away
Out in the parking lot you look up at the stars
And all the cheap cars
============================================================
Half Dead
============================================================
It was raining outside, so I cleaned house today
Spent half of the morning throwing old things away
Try not to get caught up
Try to think like a machine
Focus in on the task
Try not to think about what it means

Can't get you
Out of my head
Lost without you
Half dead

Took my spot at the window
Looked at the road
Dots and dashes of traffic
Like a message in code

And whole boxes of memories
Wrapped up at the curb
I sang songs to myself
Didn't have any words

Can't get you
Out of my head
Lost without you
Half dead

Stole out to the back yard late last night
Pine trees frozen in the silvery moonlight
Rising like giants from the cold earth
What are the years we gave each other
Ever gonna be worth?

Can't get you
Out of my head
Lost without you
Half dead
============================================================
Hand of Death
============================================================
Rehearsing for the tournament of champions
Somebody's going to have to cleanse the temple
Train by moonlight all night

Practice with a blindfold on
Try not to think too hard about the neighbors
Up on my balcony that overlooks the harbor
Preparing to deploy the hand of death
Preparing to deploy the hand of death

Rest among the ruins of old empires
Rise from my heavy sleep at sundown
Byways on my pathways beckoning

Stay focused on the target
Feel close enough to taste its beating heart
Hungry as a captive of the king
Preparing to deploy the hand of death

Sure and steady
Almost ready

Remind myself to breathe, heed thou my counsel
Skin and bones and blood and tender flesh
There will be no return to these beginnings
Preparing to deploy the hand of death
Preparing to deploy the hand of death
============================================================
Handball
============================================================
I am the dry meat that fills the mouth
I am the fire that burns without wood
I am evil forest
I kill a man on the day that his life seems sweetest to him

I did not come to play hand ball
I did not come to play hand ball

Happy birthday dear [recipient of birthday song
Happy birthday to you

Harbor Me
============================================================
Clear me a space
On the hallway closet floor
Lie to the cops
When they're at your door
Throw crumbs
Get the hounds off my tail
Make sure the coast is clear
Before you get my mail

Harbor me when I'm hungry
Harbor me when I'm hunted

Grab some shades
From the gas station rack
Living in fear
Until you come back
Sound of the key
Like an orchestral cue
Into the daylight
Thank God it's you

Harbor me when I'm shaken
Harbor me when I'm lost

Never see the day before dark
Every fugitive hour leaves its mark
Coded marks on a map
Written in my own hand
Parse it for days
Still can't understand
Bring me a candle
Bring me a match
Bring me some gasoline
Down the hatch

Harbor me when I'm breathless
Harbor me when I'm choking
============================================================
Hardpan Song
============================================================
The daylily withers, the heat kills off all the grain
And just when you think it's never gonna rain
The rain comes
The rain comes
It floods the town
Kills everybody in it

The dog runs in circles
Parolees all skip town
The heat goes on forever and ever and ever
It shows no signs of slowing town
And then the rain comes
The rain comes
It shows no signs of stopping
============================================================
Harlem Roulette
============================================================
Unknown engines underneath the city
Steam pushing up in billows through the grates
Frankie Lymon's tracking "Seabreeze" in a studio in Harlem
It's 1968
Just a pair of tunes to hammer out
Everybody's off the clock by ten
The loneliest people in the whole wide world are the ones you're never going to see again

Feels so free when I hit the avenue
Nothing like a New York summer night
Every dream's a good dream,
Even awful dreams are good dreams,
If you're doing it right

Remember soaring higher than a cloud
Get pretty sentimental now and then
The loneliest people in the whole wide world are the ones you're never going to see again

And four hours north of Portland, a radio flips on
And some no one from the future remembers that you're gone

Armies massing in the dusky distance
Ghosted in the ribbon microphone
Leave a little mark on something, maybe
Take the secret circuit home

Nothing in the shadows but the shadow hands
Reaching out to sad, young, frightened men
The loneliest people in the whole wide world are the ones you're never going to see again
Yeah, the loneliest people in the whole wide world are the ones you're never going to see again
============================================================
Harvest Song
============================================================
When you left on a Saturday night
The money'd run out and the stars were bright
And you made your way down the hall and I pulled down the shades
And I felt the heat rise again
Felt the pressure behind my eyes again
And we fell smack dab in the middle of the everglades
And the dogs howling your name
There was murder in your voice
Here comes the harvest
Here comes the harvest
Here it comes

When your letter came on a Tuesday afternoon
Six months later near the end of June
I felt the heat wash over me like a raging flood
And I felt my concentration slip
So I bit down on my lower lip
And as cicadas started singing again, I tasted blood
And the dogs howling again
There is murder in your voice
Here comes the harvest
Here comes the harvest
Here it comes
============================================================
Hast Thou Considered the Tetrapod
============================================================
You are sleeping off your demons
When I come home
Spittle bubbling on your lips
Fine white foam

I am young and I am good.
It's a hot southern California day
If I wake you up, there will be hell to pay

And alone in my room,
I am the last of a lost civilization
And I vanish into the dark
And rise above my station
Rise above my station

But I do wake you up, and when I do
You blaze down the hall and you scream
I'm in my room with the headphones on
Deep in the dream chamber
And then I'm awake and I'm guarding my face
Hoping you don't break my stereo
Because it's the one thing that I couldn't live without
And so I think about that and then I sorta black out

Held under these smothering waves
By your strong and thick veined hand
But one of these days I'm going to wriggle up on dry land
============================================================
Hatha Hill
============================================================
As the sun went away
You were sending out signals
You had sugar on your stomach
You had sugar on your hair
You had sugar underneath your eyes
You had sugar on your mouth
I know that trick too
And I know what it means, coming from you
============================================================
Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas
============================================================
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on our troubles will be out of sight

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Keep the Yuletide gay
From now on our troubles will be miles away

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

Through the years we all will be together
If the Fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

Through the years we all will be together
(In the grave, that's where we'll all actually be together, is in the grave)
If the Fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

Have to Explode
============================================================
Tile floor of the bathroom
Scrubbed clean and bright
Checkerboard white and grey
Towels from the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Kingston Jamaica
I can still see the rust colored stains today
The stage is set
Someone's going to do something someone else will regret
I speak in smoke signals and you answer in code
The fuse will have to run out sometime
Something here will eventually have to explode
Have to explode

You and me lying on the tile floor
Trying to keep cool
Restless all night
Sweating out the poison
As the temperature climbs
Staring up up at the hundred-watt light that burns above
Name one thing about us two anyone could love
We roll out the red carpet
When rotten luck comes down the road
Five four three two one
Watch for the flash
Something here will eventually have to explode
Have to explode
============================================================
Heart Would Surely Grieve
============================================================
Cut out the lightbulb
Put gunpowder in the light
And then I screw the lightbulb back into the socket
And then I turn on the light.
It will blow this place from here to hell.
It will blow this place from here to hell.

If I open up the front door
And then I open up the back door
And then I open up the windows all the way
It may cool down in here.
I could use a little cool air.
I could use a little cool air.

If I said what I'd been meaning to say
If my headache ever goes away
It'll surely cost me dearly.
It'll surely cost me dearly.
It'll surely cost me dearly.

Heartland Feeling
============================================================
Old man Johnson got his head in his hand
Makin' his way across state in a fiddlin' band
With hair all down in his eyes
And the microphone all covered with flies
When he gets done playin', goes back to his room
Climbs in the bed in his cowboy boots
And he picks up a magazine, turns on the TV
Lights a cigar as he's fallin' asleep

Well he's only a person
Who doesn't know shit
Yeah, nothin' happenin'
That's about it

Well little Rosanna came from Texarkana
Had fourteen dollars wrapped in a bandana
Came into town not lookin' for much
Well she found a hound dog and she named him Dutch
She got a job at the arcade takin' quarters
But she was never too good at takin' orders
So one night she stopped givin' out change
She kicked the boss in the shin and unplugged the games

She's only a person
Who doesn't know shit
Nothin' happenin'
That's about it

Sam got canned at the cannery
She punched out the clock that night
His knuckle was bleeding as he walked home
He was cold and he had a headache
Well his wife was cookin' canned beans
He took out all the money out of his jeans
And he set it on fire in the kitchen sink
As his wife handed him a drink

He was only a person
Who didn't know shit
Nothin' happenin' That's about it

Smiley was lookin' for handouts
Sleepin' in an abandoned lighthouse
Down at the mini-mall shakin' his hat
Washin' windows with his bare hand
He found a sports car with the keys
In the ignition it just seemed so easy
He took a joyride, drove it into a hedge
Came out with the steering wheel wrapped around his head

Well he's only a person
Who doesn't know shit
Nothin' happenin'
That's about it

Well Janie was born in a small town
Everybody just standin' around
They had bingo games and the raffle
Everybody chewin' tobacco
Well she grew up kinda restless
All her boyfriends wanted to be dentists
Well, she got a job at the truck stop
And she got old fast and never did what she wanted

She's only a person
Who doesn't know shit
Nothin' happenin'
That's about it

Hebrews 11:40
============================================================
Masks hanging on the tomb walls
Where the coven grieves
Witches hiding in the brambles
Ground level down where the dry leaves
Blow and burn slowly
No ground is ever gonna hold me

Bright candles in the manor
Where the curse takes hold
Bodies reassembling down where the worms crawl
Make your own friends when the world's gone cold

It gets dark and then
I feel certain I am going to rise again
If not by faith then by the sword
I'm going to be restored

Build fires to keep the beacon flashing
Where the earth lies flat
Blood calls to blood as the hours draw down
Invent my own family if it comes to that
Hold them close, hold them near
Tell them no one's ever going to hurt them here

Steal the treasure and try to leave town
Fight my way back down
Don't want to hurt anyone
Probably gonna have to before it's all done

Take to the hills, run away
I'm gonna get my perfect body back someday
If not by faith then by the sword
I'm going to be restored
============================================================
Heel Turn 1
============================================================
The ushers and the guys who chuck the popcorn
They feel the rush of stillness in the air
They turn toward the ring from where they're standing
I'm just lying there
But I prop myself bolt upright on one hand
And I pull up on my haunches and I face the crowd
The guy who knocked me down has got his back turned
In comes the great grey pestilent cloud

I, I, I'm not gonna die in here
I, I, I'm not gonna die in here

Work hard to be a hero all my life
Always try to turn the other cheek
And save my closed-fist punches for the ones who throw them first
Always show some mercy to the wounded and the weak
Always help a guy back to his feet
Always help old ladies cross the street
I watch my guardian angel leave the building
I am my only friend
One thing about the good guys that I've noticed
They always beg for mercy in the end

And I, I, I'm not gonna die in here
I, I, I'm not gonna die in here
I, I, I'm not gonna die in here
I, I, I'm not gonna die in here
============================================================
Heel Turn 2
============================================================
Get stomped like a snake
Lie down in the dirt
Cling to my convictions
Even when I get hurt
Be an upstanding well-loved man about town
In your child’s mind that's how it goes down

But I tried
The losing side
I don't want to die in here
I don't want to die in here

Drift down into the new dark light
Without any reservations
You found my breaking point
Congratulations
Spent too much of my life now trying to play fair
Throw my better self overboard, shoot at him when he comes up for air

Come unhinged
Get revenge
I don't want to die in here
I don't want to die in here

Stay good under pressure
For years and years and years and years
President of the fan club up there
Choking on his tears

Let all the trash rain down
From way up in the rafters
I'm walking out of here in one piece
Don't care what comes after

Drive the wedge
Torch the bridge
I don’t want to die in here
I don’t want to die in here
============================================================
Heights
============================================================
When the seashells crumbled in your hand
You looked up up at me
And the sands shifting underneath your feet
Softened for you and incredibly
The sun withdrew from the sky
And I was certain I was going to cry

But then you reached up and you reached out
We'd been staring at the water all day
And then you touched me; you were golden
You were giving the game away

When the sand crabs ran across your face
You didn't even twitch
And a salt scent came across the water
Impossibly rich
Impossibly cold
We were just nineteen years old

And then you reached up and you reached out
We'd been staring at the water all day
And then you touched me; you were golden
You were giving the game away
============================================================
Hellhound on My Trail
============================================================
Gotta keep moving, gotta keep moving
Blues falling down like hail
Gotta keep moving
Blues falling down like hail
And the daylight keeps moving (??)
There's a hellhound on my trail

If today were Christmas evening
And tomorrow Christmas day
If today were Christmas evening
And tomorrow Christmas day
All I would need is but a little sweet rider
And the world would fade away

Gotta keep moving, gotta keep moving
Blues falling down like hail
Gotta keep moving
Blues falling down like hail
And the daylight keeps to worrying
There's a hellhound on my trail
============================================================
Hello, Old Rabbit
============================================================
I saw the long row of bluebells
Saw the foxglove and the nightshade
I saw the whole garden and I thought a while about
How I'd been waiting for you since the second grade
The flowers made the air boil
The boiling air made me think of you a while

I did not come here to suffer
I did not come here to suffer

I heard the ducks all quacking
I saw the sunshine on the lake
Saw you standing near the water
And wondered how long I'd be paying for one dumb mistake
The sight of you was really something else
But I don't know what that something else was

I did not come here to suffer
I did not come here to suffer
============================================================
Hello Sarah
============================================================
I took the horse-tooth necklace
Down from the nail where it was hanging
And I wound it three times 'round my wrist
And felt that stinging, ringing feeling come down
I remember you
I remember what we used to do
Hello Sarah
Hello Sarah
Hello Sarah

I looked around the newly-excavated cave
And I saw that centuries had
Left our little room unchanged
And I felt your spirit moving, it made perfect sense
I heard the jangling of your ornaments
Hello Sarah
Hello Sarah
Hello Sarah
============================================================
Hello There Howard
============================================================
The guy on my right is new
And he says he feels kinda sad and his hands are cold
And he refuses the dice
So I pick 'em up myself
I let 'em roll

And the little white spots gleam like stars
The guy on my right gets a look at the stickman
And he begins to sense where it is that we are
And the table's hot
But so am I
And I grab the bones and I let 'em fly
So come two come three come four come five
Come six come seven come nine
It doesn't matter to me now
'Cause I've got all kinds of time
============================================================
Here I Am
============================================================
I've waited longer for lesser things but
Here I am
Who really knows what tomorrow brings but
Here I am
Just in case you were wondering
Just in case you got lost again
Just in case you run out of friends
Here I am

It's so easy to rip and to tear, so
Here I am
What you need most vanishes into thin air, so
Here I am
Rocks and compasses may stay true
It doesn't really matter what you do
I have never forgotten you
Here I am

Some days our reach is bound to exceed our grasp
I gave up hoping long ago I could fix the past

Today I called you for the very first time in a
Million years
You would never know if I told you so of these
Million tears
Life doesn't wave as it's speeding past
Grab on tight and hold on fast
And don't ever forget to fight this good fight
Here I am
============================================================
Here I Am, Lord
============================================================
Lyrics sung by John at 2024-03-01 - Noise Pop 2024 - Grace Cathedral - San Francisco, CA
I, the Lord of snow and rain
I have borne my people's pain
I have wept for love of them
They turn away

I will break their hearts of stone
Give them hearts for love alone
I will speak my word to them
Whom shall I send?

Here I am, Lord. Is it I, Lord?
I have heard you calling in the night
I will go, Lord, if you lead me
I will hold your people in my heart

I, the Lord of wind and flame
I will tend the poor and lame
I will set a feast for them
My hand will save

Finest bread I will provide
'Til their hearts be satisfied
I will give my life to them
Whom shall I send?

Here I am, Lord. Is it I, Lord?
I have heard you calling in the night
I will go, Lord, if you lead me
I will hold your people in my heart

I, the Lord of sea and sky
I have heard my people cry
All who dwell in dark and sin
My hand will save

I, who made the stars of night
I will make their darkness bright
Who will bear my light to them?
Whom shall I send?

Here I am, Lord. Is it I, Lord?
I have heard you calling in the night
I will go, Lord, if you lead me
I will hold your people in my heart
I will hold your people in my heart

Heretic Pride (Song)
============================================================
Well they come and pull me from my house
And they drag my body through the streets
And the sun’s so hot I think I’ll catch fire and burn up
In the summer air so moist and sweet

And the people all come out to cheer
Rocks in the pathway break my skin
And there’s honeysuckle on the faint breeze today
With every breath I’m drawing in

I want to cry out but I don’t scream and I don’t shout
And I feel so proud to be alive
And I feel so proud when the reckoning arrives

Crowds grow denser by the second
As we near the center of the town
And they dig a trench right in the main square right there
And they pick me up and throw me down

And I start laughing like a child
And I mark their faces one by one
Transfiguration’s gonna come for me at last
And I will burn hotter than the sun

I’ve waited so long and now I taste jasmine on my tongue
And I feel so proud to be alive
And I feel so proud when the reckoning arrives
============================================================
High Doses Number 2
============================================================
We all woke up that morning
Claw marks on our little faces
The dull thud from the treetops
The echo in the hollow places
Rose up high and lonely
Wringing my hands, grinding my teeth
All the triumph overhead
All the disaster underneath

Spat out my morning prayers
Desperate pleas and vicious lies
Felt the sunlight through the grating
Covered up my eyes
Woke up feeling awful
Shook my head to drive the ghosts away
This is just a flesh wound
And it will clear up any day
But the present I got planned for you pricks
Is gonna be a little harder to fix

Thank god
For small favors
In high doses

Heard the voices through the air vents
Listen to them squeal
The great big world is out there
The hidden one beneath my heel
Called up my sister in Reseda
Left a message at the tone
All the points where contact fails us
All of the dead spots in the zone

And the acid in my throat
Every time I try to talk
The songs that keep me up at night
Standing on that solid rock
Rose up high and dry and lonely
Stumbled coming out the gate
This is just a paper cut
And it will scab over, just you wait
But the cuts that I'll shortly begin dealing out
Are gonna give you something to cry about

Thank god
For small favors
In high doses
============================================================
High Hawk Season
============================================================
I heard the wings beat
on the wind tonight
As the heat stole power from
the darkening light
I saw the streets fill up
with people that I knew
People who looked like you

Rise if you're sleeping, stay awake
We are young supernovas and
the heat's about to break

Drift through the streets,
walk between the cars
Newborn sons and daughters
spat forth from distant stars
The summer will reveal itself
to those whose hearts are true
And to the faithless few

Rise if you're sleeping, stay awake
We are young supernovas and
the heat's about to break

Who will rise and who will sink?
Who's going to stand his ground
and who's going to blink?
Surge forward from Van Cortlandt Park
like frightened sheep
Spirit throngs that hoist us high,
three thousand warriors deep

Spray our dreams on any surface
where the paint will stick
Try to time the rhythm,
listen for the click

Rise if you're sleeping, stay awake
We are young supernovas and
the heat's about to break
============================================================
High School Confidential
============================================================
You look so cool in your summer dress.
You look so cool in your summer dress.
You walk across the high school campus
In the bright sunshine,
You can't imagine my surprise when your gaze meets mine.
And I may be young, but I know
What you're thinking.

You look so cool as you glide into the teacher's lounge.
You look so cool as you glide into the teacher's lounge.
And I may be only seventeen,
But I know what that look means.
And if you think I'm all talk and no action,
Try me.

I touch your thin hand as we roll back into town.
In your car I touch your thin hand later on as we roll back into town.
After words you drop me off one block away
And I'm young and strong and healthy,
It's a bright spring day.
And it may be that it's just me, but in the sunlight
You look different.
============================================================
Historiography
============================================================
There was rain, there was wind
There was spring coming in
There was a feeling of approaching doom
And I was happy to see you
It was cold in your room and you were warm and that's all I remember
And your arms were warm and that's all I remember

Later on near morning
We were talking about nothing
A little rain, a little wind
Quiet cold, cold air coming in
And you were warm and that's all I remember
And your arms were warm and that's all I remember
And your eyes were pretty and that's all I remember
And your hands were soft and that's all I remember
And the hall was well-lit as I walked down it and that's all I remember
And the rain was light and it felt soft on my face and that's all I remember
And the car was quiet inside and that's all I remember
And it was dark but the sunlight was coming and that's all I remember

History of the Church (Part 1)
============================================================
In the early days of the Christian Church
There was a movement among freethinking Christians called gnosticism
Now the gnostics believed that the incarnation of Christ had been entirely illusory
And their reasoning was as follows
That if God is holy and the body is unholy
Then God would not inhabit a body
Hence people had been seeing things when Christ walked the earth

Now about this time lived a man named Polycarp
Polycarp had received his teaching at the hands of John the Apostle
It was Polycarp's earnest belief that the gnostics were heretics
And he visited Rome to tell them so

He met up with a guy named Marcion
Extremely influential among the gnostics
And Marcion, realizing Polycarp's status at having studied under John the Apostle
demanded that he be recognized
Polycarp was about sixty years old and he extended an aging arm
And pointed toward Marcion and said I recognize
I recognize
I recognize
The first born son of Satan
That was Polycarp

Holidays in the Sun
============================================================
I don't want to holiday in the sun
I want to go to the new Belsen
I want to see some history
Cause now I got a reasonable economy

Oh now I got a reason
Now I got a reason
Now I got a reason
And I'm still waiting
Now I got a reason
Now I got a reason
To be waiting
The Berlin Wall

In Sensurround sound in a two inch wall
Well I was waiting for the communist call
I didn't ask for sunshine
And I got world war three
I'm looking over the wall
And they're looking at me

Oh now I got a reason
Now I got a reason
Now I got a reason
And I'm still waiting
Now I got a reason
Now I got a reason
To be waiting
The Berlin Wall

I don't understand this bit at all
Looks like cheap B movie stuff
Cheap dialogue, cheap essential scenery
I'm gonna go over the wall
I don't understand this bit at all
I'm gonna go under the wall
I'm gonna go over the Berlin Wall
I don't understand this bit at all
Please don't be waiting for me

Home Again Garden Grove
============================================================
Wipe down the windshields and roll down the windows
Let's go where the jackals are breeding
Wrap this bandanna around your head
Don't let anyone see that you're bleeding

Fire up the scanner and keep your eyes on it
Don't speak unless someone speaks to you
Hands in your pockets and sun on your face
The warm love of God coursing through you

Home again
Home again
Garden Grove
Garden Grove

I can remember when we were in high school
Our dreams were like fugitive warlords
Plotting triumphant returns to the city
Keeping TEC-9's tucked under the floorboards, ah-ha

Now we are practical men of the world
We tether our dreams to the turf
And cruise down these alleys for honey to feed them
Jellyfish riding the surf

Shoving our heads
Straight into the guts of the stove
Home again
Garden Grove
Garden Grove
============================================================
Home on the Range
============================================================
Oh give me a home where the buffalo roam
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day

Home, home on the range
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day

Where the air is so pure, and the zephyrs so free
The breezes so balmy and light
That I would not exchange my home on the range
For all your fair cities so bright

Home, home on the range
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day

How often at night when the heavens are bright
By the light of the glittering stars
How I stood there amazed and observed as I gazed
That their glory exceeds that of ours

Home, home on the range
Where the deer and the antelope play
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word
And the skies are not cloudy all day

Hommel West (Onward to Tasmania)
============================================================
And then we came to the part of the story
Where the corners started getting tight
Ears pressed up against the motel wall
Listening to disembodied voices all night, all night

Lamp on the chintzy end table
Beer bottle full of cigarette butts
Knock at the door and then silence
Answer it if you've got the guts

If you've got a smoke and dust and spiders
Hot exhaust and brine and mosquitos
And you, like a boy scout
Brave, loyal, and true

If they come with their colors all out on display
Well that'd be one thing, alright
But when they dress themselves up like the Latter-Day Saints
We let 'em in and lock the door tight, lock 'em up tight

When we project our black and white films on the wall
You can hear their stomachs turn
Your eyes on mine and mine fixed on the door
And everybody in here's gonna burn

Everybody smoke and dust and spiders
Hot exhaust and brine and mosquitos
And you, like a boy scout
Brave, loyal, and true

Hopeful Assassins of Zeno
============================================================
Get tired of coming in from the mountains every year
Find some place to set up shop around here
Spread out a little, circulate
A log that floats down river
Will certainly take on weight

Meet some people, make some friends
How long till we get sent back to the mountains?
It all depends

On the hopeful
And the cunning
And the faithful
The well-positioned
Filthy but graceful

Get familiar with affairs of state
Foretell the future
Get a pretty good success rate
Notch some wins, take some losses
Be nice to the guys who wear necklaces with crosses
They will stab you in the back

You gotta turn the other cheek
You gotta learn to love Jesus, so to speak

Like the hopeful
And the cunning
And the faithful
The well-positioned
Filthy but graceful

Real filthy, think about getting clean
Even hear the soldiers talk about it, down at the canteen
Little kings keep coming, one another's head
Which is exactly how the portents read
Watch with wonder
Fail to discern
These people never learn
How long until the snake devours its tail?
Longer than we think

Still it's gotta happen sometime
Until then, raise a drink

To the hopeful
And the cunning
And the faithful
The well-positioned
Filthy but graceful
============================================================
Horse and Master
============================================================
Pass by the outer walkway where the dark elms grow
Time slows down a little, just a stone's throw
Away from the pit in the earth
Where we slept like horse and master
Before the disaster

Slip through the front gate where the windows blaze
Views this near the Arctic Circle stretching out for days
It's all still here too, it'll all survive you
Standing tall on the earth
Where we slept like horse and master
Before the disaster
============================================================
Horseradish Road
============================================================
The way that everybody's voice
Comes out muffled when they speak
The way we take our diminishing inventories
Month to month and
Week to week
The Maria Callas records
On the stereo all the time
you're gonna get yours
And I'm gonna get mine

'Cause in this car, in this car
Somebody's bound to get burned
I know, I know
Because I've been watching the road turn

The Enigma Variations on the radio
The things that I could guess at
The things that I already know
And the twelve thousand dollars
That turned up in your purse
You've done something awful
I've done something worse

And in this car, in this car
Somebody's bound to get burned
I know, I know
'Cause I've been watching the road turn
============================================================
Hospital Reaction Shot
============================================================
Let the tube lights buzz overhead
Tell the papers that you're dead
You'd want them to be the first to know
Gone down where the goblins go

Head down headed for the curtain call
I'm the last to try to break your fall
Last high tide before the undertow
Gone down where the goblins go

If I'd as much money as I could spend
I never would cry
Old chairs to mend

There's no kingdom
There's no road
Just old sets where faulty flash pots explode
Head out to the sidewalk
On with the show
Gone down where the goblins go

If I'd as much money as I could spend
I never would cry
Old chairs to mend

There's no kingdom
There's no road
Just old sets where faulty flash pots explode
Head out to the sidewalk
On with the show
Gone down where the goblins go
============================================================
Hostages
============================================================
There may come a day someday
When we all look back and laugh
But there's lots of noise in the break room
Nasty points on the graph

And they're breaking into the broadcast now
Special update from Action News!
Some of what you'll hear in the footage that follows
May not reflect our station's views

We may run out of bullets;
We're never going to run out of hostages

There's disagreements on procedure
Vocal, bitter divisions
As is often the case in situations like this one
I'll be the one who makes the final decision

Some of you have been here before
Most of you have not
Some will dwell on the details in the future
Or work to keep it out of your thoughts

We may run out of bullets;
We're never going to run out of hostages

If there's one thing I love
It's an infinite resource
If there's one thing worth loving
It's a surplus of supplies

There's a team up on the rooftop
Good luck to the team
When you know you'll never make it out alive
You kind of get to live out your dream

Helicopters in the distance
Music of the spheres on the wind
It's gonna be a rough ride from here down to the exit
Some might look back and laugh at the end

We may run out of bullets;
We're never going to run out of hostages
============================================================
Hotel Road
============================================================
Thirty story hotel overlooking the sea
Friends on either arm supporting me
It's hard to walk now
But I will go down somehow
I'm going down the old road
I'm going down the old road

Children kick a soccer ball around in the street
Kalpadruma trees are melting in the heat
It's hard to walk here
Where the waves shine so clear
I'm going down the old road
I'm going down, down the old road

Above the swollen ocean, the burning yellow sun
Hits the hotel's mylar windows catching everyone
It's hard to say why
I should come here to die
I'm going down the old road
I'm going down the old road
============================================================
Houseguest
============================================================
Mailman came while you were out
I was sleeping at your house
Letter from your lover
With an Ottawa address

Fill the shower up with steam
Find out what you mean to him
Before I hand it over
I'll push the flap back down and press
Yes, I'll leave everything the way I found it

I'll bet I'm the best
House guest
House guest you've ever had
I'll bet I'm the best
House guest
House guest you've ever had

I never leave my socks around
I always keep the TV down
And when I leave
I never leave
A mess

We were resting on the couch
There was nothing much to watch
Other than my manners
And your waning graciousness
Ease your thumb off the remote
Place my palms against your throat
The heat in here's infernal
And so's that entry in your journal
Yeah, it changed everything the day I found it

I'll bet I'm the best
House guest
House guest you've ever had
I'll bet I'm the best
House guest
To ever crash at your pad

I've done things in your room
You'd be ashamed to accuse me of
It's just a tendency I have when certain people
Refuse me love
Refuse me love
Refuse me love
You refuse, I accuse

Yes, I'll leave everything the way I found it
============================================================
How I Left the Ministry
============================================================
There was one thing I found that I couldn't help thinking
As they pried me free with the jaws of life
None of this disaster would ever have happened
If I had not been driving my neighbor's wife

To the Alta Loma Days Inn, where I'd registered us as
A couple with a name I'm sure some other couple somewhere has

And the last thing I saw before falling unconscious
Was your right hand tracing a heart on my thigh
And I thought my God what an infantile gesture
And I thought my God what an indescribable high

The autumn air was sweeter than a slice of wedding cake
As I overshot the exit and I tried and failed to find the brake
============================================================
How to Embrace a Swamp Creature
============================================================
Got out of bed, could not remember my own name
Condemned to walk the soil amongst all creatures wild and tame
Go where I go, do what I must
Crawl starving on my belly
Licking up the dry dust

I see the light in your window
Ride the elevator to the sixth floor
Stand with my arms at my sides as you open up the door

But I’m out of my element I can’t breathe
I’m out of my element
I can’t breathe

Alone with your bathroom mirror
Try to get my head straight
Breathe on the glass and wait for it to clear
Clean slate

Meet up with you in the kitchen
Where the air is hot and dry
Open up all the faucets
Be fruitful and multiply

I stand where the flashing swords gleam
And I try to shake my head clear of the dream

But I’m out of my element I can’t breathe
I’m out of my element
I can’t breathe

I start to sweat, I can’t cool down
I’m scared of all the strangers in this town
I try to tell you just why I’ve come
It’s like I’ve got molasses on my tongue

I made it through town somehow
But who’s going to save me now?

I’m out of my element I can’t breathe
I’m out of my element
I can’t breathe
============================================================
Hye Kye
============================================================
In December in California, the air was hot
And I carried the Christmas tree down Indian Hill
To the Gemco parking lot
What did I see, what spectacle confronted me
Ten thousand Christmas trees

And the people standing around, and the smiles on their faces
And the boards in the shapes of Xs
Hammered into the Christmas trees bases
I took in the smell, I looked around
And among ten thousand Christmas trees
I lay down
============================================================
Hypnotized
============================================================
So that's how you found me, rain falling around me
Looking down at a worm, a long way to go
And the traffic was hissing by
And I was homesick and I was high

I was surrounded by a language
In which I could say only hello
And thank you very much
But you spoke so I could understand
And I drew a treasure map on your hand

And you were no picnic, you were no prize
But you had just enough pathos to keep me hypnotized
Hypnotized, hypnotized

The map led to an island
In a sea of store-bought dreams
Where soulless singers sang
Over beats made by machines
And lovely girls were hovering above me like gulls
With their long slender necks and their delicate skulls

And I was no picnic, I was no prize
But I had just enough sweetness
To keep you hypnotized
Hypnotized, hypnotized

I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry
============================================================
Hear that lonesome whippoorwill
He sounds too blue to fly.
The midnight train is riding low.
I'm so lonesome I could cry.

I've never seen a night so long,
when time goes crawling by.
the moon just went behind the clouds
to hide its face and die.

did you ever see a robin weep
when leaves begin to die?
that means he's lost the will to live.
I'm so lonesome I could cry.

the sign has come, a falling star.
like love, a purple sky.
they'll never wonder where you are.
I'm so lonesome I could cry.

I'm so lonesome I could cry.
============================================================
I've Been Kissed by a Do
============================================================
Linus came in.
Snoopy jumped up and down.
Lucy came.
She got licked and washed it off again.
Far away and long.
Think of things to do.

He licked her and she rat.
I've been kissed by a do.
Washed it off with water.
============================================================
I've Got the Sex
============================================================
Crushing strawberries one by one
Watching the juice drip down
Two and a half months ahead of schedule
The leaves on the trees are turning brown
We got ready for winter, as the sun rose up in the sky
There was something almost soothing in the hard-to-define
Note of terror in your eye

Watching the strawberries lose their shapes
As the wind blew through the elm tree
The wind was far too cold for the middle of April
And you reached out your hand to me
It was good to feel your hand in mine
It was good to know you felt the chill too
I scooped up a palm full of strawberry pulp
And smeared it all over you

The wild strawberries drove me on, as I lapped them up off of your skin
And I could feel your basal body temperature rise as the cold came in
Hey hey
============================================================
I Ain't Livin' Long Like This
============================================================
I looked for trouble and I found it, son
Straight out the barrel of a lawman's gun
I tried to run but I don't think I can
He said make one move, you're dead man
I ain't living long like this
I can't live at all like this, can I now
He slipped those handcuffs up behind my back
Let me cool out against the cold steel rack

Grew up in Houston off of Wayside Drive
Son of a carhop in some all-night dive
Dad drove a stock car to an early death
All I remember is a drunk man's breath
I ain't living long like this
I can't live at all like this, can I now
You heard the story about the wheel go round
Don't let 'em take you son, they're all downtown

I live for Angel, she's a roadhouse queen
Make Texas Ruby look like Sandra Dee
I wanna love her, I don't know how
I'm at the bottom of the jailhouse now
I ain't living long like this
I can't live at all like this
You heard the story about the wheel go round
Don't let them take you, take you, take you downtown
I ain't living long like this
============================================================
I Am Morris Townsend
============================================================
Well I might drive up to Virginia
Just to see the leaves aflame
In the autumn I just stay inside
Last year I missed her when she came

I scratched some words down on a napkin
Time to go home and get some sleep
But I hang around and I drink another down
Oh god I think I'll never leave

But I had so much love to give when I was seventeen

Well Catherine's waiting by the window
Yeah alone she keeps her company
For the doctor thinks she oughtta stay at home
Yeah far away from me

But I had so much love to give when I was seventeen
I had so much love to give when I was seventeen
============================================================
I Corinthians 13: 8-10
============================================================
We heard the rats in the rafters scurry by
And we wondered about the color of the sky outside
In Warsaw in 1939
It was alright just to be alive
It was good that you were mine
And you held your hands up
To form a heart in the air
You held your hands up with your thumbs touching
They formed a heart in the air

Through the piece missing in the brick wall
We had an excellent view of the soldiers coming down the hall
And you held your hands up where I could see them
In the dark and they formed a heart in the air
You held your hands up
And they formed a heart in the air

I heard the old songs radiating from you
I heard the old songs radiating from you
============================================================
I Don't Want to Get Adjusted
============================================================
In this world of toil and trouble
Sometimes lonesome, sometimes blue
Yet the hope of life eternal
Brightens all our hopes anew

I don't want to get adjusted to this world, to this world
I don't want to get adjusted to this world
I got a home so much better
I got to go there sooner or later
I don't want to get adjusted to this world

Well this world is sad and weary
There's no place that feels like home
Jesus come my soul to ferry
Where I never more shall roam

I don't want to get adjusted to this world, to this world
I don't want to get adjusted to this world
I got a home so much better
I got to go there sooner or later
I don't want to get adjusted to this world

I am longing for the coming
Of my savior, lord, and king
I can hear my loved one singing
A new song I'd like to sing

I don't want to get adjusted to this world, to this world
I don't want to get adjusted to this world
I got a home so much better
I got to go there sooner or later
I don't want to get adjusted to this world
============================================================
I Hear the Planets
============================================================
They'll come at you with all manner of astronomical sorcery
They'll be pulling you back as you make your way up the highway
You can tell 'em from me that they don't know anything about anything
They can just stand back with their amateur interpretations of scripture 'cause

I hear the planets singing our names
And I see you making your way up the hillside
And I can see the Pacific from here
The waves are calm and the water's clear
And I hear the planets singing our names

When you're with me you'll see their smooth forms taking shape in the sky
And I will hold your hand and move my thumb around there in your palm
And the constellations will all display their bright colors up above and around us
And many are the plans in the human heart
But the purposes of Yahweh, they stand firm

And I hear the planets singing our names
And I see you making your way up the hillside
And I can see the Pacific from here
The waves are calm and the water's clear
And I hear the planets singing our names
============================================================
I Hope You Dance
============================================================
I hope you never lose your sense of wonder
You get your fill to eat but always keep that hunger
May you never take one single breath for granted
God forbid love ever leave you empty-handed

I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean
Whenever one door closes, I hope one more opens
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance
============================================================
I Know You've Come to Take My Toys Away
============================================================
Sun flashing red and then orange, then opting for secession
On the day when you come to the door with your terrible confession
And I know you've come to take my toys away
And I know you've come to take my toys away

Skin flushing red and then glowing when you come inside
And the moonlight watching all over you, I have got my mouth open wide
And I know you've come to take my toys away
And I know you've come to take my toys away
Oh and when it drops you're gonna feel it
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
============================================================
I Love You, Let's Light Ourselves on Fire
============================================================
What's going to be the death of me
Static electricity
What's making me take it all too far
You are
You are

What's keeping me up at night
The streetlight
What's finally gonna let me sleep alright
You might
You might

How do I know what I know
Where did our love go
How come the river froze over this year
What are we hiding here
I saw you waiting by the mailbox
I saw the mailman come
Saw the neighbors poke their heads out of their windows
I saw everyone
============================================================
I Meant Every Word I Said in New Delhi
============================================================
I know when you look at the photographs
They don't do much for you
I know you see the fires raging
Baby, I see them too
And even though
You got your options all lined up in a row
There is something I want you to know
I meant every word I said in New Delhi
Every word, every word, every word

I don't know where you're going
And I don't wanna know either
I know you're heading north
I know you've kept the keys in your pocket
Breathe in, I see the moon shining down you
I know that you remember, I can see it burning though
And in Sanskrit, they got a word for it
Savasana, Savasana
Savasana, Savasana
============================================================
I Might Compare
============================================================
Wind through the weed in the fields
Fields full of wheat this year
Sky turning white outside
You should see the view from here
I have been studying how I might compare
This prison where I live to something

Last of the cars long gone
Sleep on the roof all day
Warm in the cold spring sun
There will be the devil to pay
I have been studying how I might compare
I have been studying how I might compare
I have been studying how I might compare
This prison where I live to something
============================================================
I Miss the War
============================================================
I wish the war was on,
I know this sounds strange to you.
I miss the war-time life,
Anything could happen then:
Around a corner, behind a door.

I miss the cannon fire,
I miss the air strikes at night.
Down on the basement floor,
We held each other tight,
We held each other tight.
It rained plaster, it rained glass,
We held on for our life.

I wish the war was on,
I know this sounds strange to you.
My poor crippled con,
My sad one-legged Jew,
I see what it's done to you.

I wish the war was on,
We really worked together then.
Do you remember when
You held the horse, I slit his throat,
The blood ran, melting the snow?
It rained plaster, it rained glass,
We held on for our life.
============================================================
I Put a Spell on You
============================================================
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
Stop the things you do
Look out, I ain't lying
I can't stand
No running around
I can't stand
No putting me down
I love you
I love you
I love you anyhow
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
============================================================
I Shall Not Be Moved
============================================================
Glory hallelujah, I shall not be moved
Anchored in Jehovah, I shall not be moved
Just like a tree that's planted by the water
Lord, I shall not be moved

I shall not be, I shall not be moved
I shall not be, I shall not be moved
Just like a tree that's planted by the water
Lord, I shall not be moved
============================================================
I Think I'll Just Stay Here and Drink
============================================================
I could be holding you tonight
I could quit doing wrong and start doing right
You don't care about what I think
I think I'll just stay here and drink

You're hurting me now, don't square the deal
At least you'll know the way I feel
I'll take all the money in the bank
I think I'll just stay here and drink

Listen close and you will hear
That old jukebox playing in my ear
Ain't no woman gonna change the way I think
I think I'll just stay here and drink

Hurting you now won't mean a thing
Since love ain't here it don't feel the pain
My mind ain't nothing but a total blank
I think I'll just stay here and drink
I think I'll just stay here and drink
I think I'll just stay here and drink
I think I'll just stay here and drink
I think I'll just stay here and drink
============================================================
I Will Escape This Loathsome Dungeon
============================================================
Water dripping on the paving stones
Foreshortened muscles, arthritic bones
Walls of solid brick, strong iron anchor chain two inches thick and eight feet long
Walk in heavy circles as I sing my pacing song

I will
I will
I will
I will escape this loathsome dungeon

What if my chain broke, what then?
Walk to where the light runs out, turn around again
============================================================
I Will Grab You by the Ears
============================================================
The wind blew in across the water
And the wind blew through your hair
And I walked around the lake's perimeter
And then I saw you there

I will grab you by the ears
I will grab you by the ears
I will grab you by the ears
And you will know something
You will know something

I saw the birds fly out across the lake
I saw the birds go by
And I walked around the lake's perimeter
And I saw the lake reflected in your eyes

I will grab you by the ears
I will grab you by the ears
I will grab you by the ears
And you will know something
You will know something
============================================================
I Will Survive
============================================================
first I was afraid
I was petrified
Kept thinking I could never live
without you by my side
but then I spent so many nights
just feeling sorry for myself
and I grew strong
and I learned how to carry on
and now you're back
from outer space
I just walked in to find you here
with that sad look upon your face
I should have that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
if I had known for just one second
you'd be back to bother me

go on now go walk out the door
just turn around now
'cause you're not welcome anymore
weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
did you think I'd crumble
did you think I'd lay down and die
well no, not I
I will survive
yeah, as long as i know how to live
I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
and I've got all my love to give
and I'll survive
I will survive
hey hey
============================================================
I Wonder Where Our Love Has Gone
============================================================
All I know is I'm in love with you
Even though you say that we are through
I know without your love, I just can't go on
I wonder where our love has gone

Always thought you'd love me more and more
Never dreamed you'd ever let me go
I know without your love, I just can't go on
I wonder where our love has gone

Now what did I do and what did I say
That ever could lead you to treat me this way
If I've been untrue, I'm willing to pay
And darling if that's not enough, I'll do anything you say

So darling please, wherever you may be
Hear my plea and hurry home to me
I know without your love, I just can't go on
I wonder where our love has gone
============================================================
Ice Blue
============================================================
The sky was pale, the day was gloomy
Boy your eyes burned through me

Thought that I knew what colors were
Ha ha ha, ha ha ha

Thought that I knew what colors were
Before I saw you
Ice blue
============================================================
Ice Cream, Cobra Man
============================================================
I have a hand disfigured by snakebite
I have a couple of things that I really like
And I am heading your way all the time

I'm going to move all my vital organs
to someplace outside my body
The wiring is something you would not believe

I feel no pain as I float across your ceiling, and I --
I have no shame
I am in a thousand rooms all at the same time
Yeah and I have a glass
filled with water and light, and I feel good tonight
I am climbing up this mountain
You can watch me. You can watch me.
============================================================
Idylls of the King
============================================================
This place with its old plantations
These roads leading out to the sea
This day full of promise and potential
More clay pigeons for you and me
All of them all of them
All of them all of them
All of them all of them all of them all of them
All lined up

Huge crows loitering by the curb
Our shared paths unraveling behind us like ribbons
And I dreamed of vultures
In the trees around our house
And cicadas and locusts
And the shrieking of innumerable gibbons
All of them all of them
All of them all of them
All of them all of them all of them all of them
All lined up

How long will we ride this wave out?
How long 'til someone caves under the pressure?
My dreams are haunted by armies armies of ghosts
Faces too blurry to make out
Numbers far too high to measure
Your face like a vision straight out of Holly Hobbie
Late light drizzling through your hair
Your eyes twin volcanoes
Bad ideas dancing around in there
All all of them all of them
All of them all of them
All of them all of them all of them all of them
All lined up
============================================================
If England Were What England Seems, Then We Would Only Have Our Dreams
============================================================
I told you I was never going back
I was trying to breathe evenly
When the phone stopped ringing for the first time in a long time
And you flashed that smile at me
And then you opened up the window
I felt the air roll in
In the place where the world stops forever
In the place where your body begins

You were staring down at the street below
There was nobody there
They built a fire down there in the alley
I saw the fires rising everywhere
And then you opened up the window
The north wind began to blow
We were just a few short hours from something really special
And I heard you singing soft and low
Hey
============================================================
If You See Light
============================================================
When the villagers come to my door
I will hide underneath the table in the dining room
Knees drawn up to my chest

When the villagers come to my door
I will breathe shallow breaths from high up in my stomach
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Waiting for the front door to splinter
Waiting all winter

When the villagers come to my door
I'll be all tucked away with my face to the floor
And my eyes closed

And no one knows how to keep secrets 'round here
They tell everyone everything soon as they know
And then where is there left for poor sinners to go?

Waiting for the front door to splinter
Waiting all winter
============================================================
In Corolla
============================================================
The day I turned my back on all you people
I felt an itching in my thumbs
Salt air like a broadcast from the distant dark beyond
When my transformation comes

I went down to the warm warm water
Saw a pelican fly past
Waved once at the highway and then left all that behind me
I went wading through the grass

And no one was gonna come and get me
There wasn't anybody gonna know
Even though I leave a trail of burned things in my wake
Every single place I go

And it was cool and it was quiet
In the humid marsh down there
I let my head sink down beneath the brackish water
Felt it gumming up my hair

The sun was sinking into the Atlantic
The last time that I turned my back on you
I tried to summon up a little prayer as I went under
It was the best that I could do

And I said let them all fare better than your servant
The reeds all pricking at my skin
Here's hoping they have better luck than I had down here with them
All that water rushing in
============================================================
In Germany Before the War
============================================================
In Germany, before the war
There was a man who owned a store
In nineteen hundred thirty-four
In Düsseldorf
And every night at 5:09
He'd cross the park down to the Rhine
And he'd sit there by the shore

I'm looking at the river
But I'm thinking of the sea
I'm thinking of the sea
I'm looking at the river
But I'm thinking of the sea

A little girl has lost her way
With hair of gold and eyes of gray
Reflected in his glasses
As he watches her
A little girl has lost her way
With hair of gold and eyes of gray

I'm looking at the river
But I'm thinking of the sea

We lie beneath the autumn sky
My little golden girl and I
And she lies very still
============================================================
In League with Dragons (song)
============================================================
It's so hard to get revenge
The human element drags you down
Lead a solitary life if you can
Try not to show your face in town
Let the rumors find such bridges as they may
Reckon up the variables
Find a way to make it real
Make a deal
Until my protector comes

It's so hard to be yourself
When you've already seen the inside
Try to navigate the turns as best you can
Headed on down the slide
Strong friends are where you find them
People talk all kinds of trash
Never you mind them
Make it real
Make a deal
Until my protector comes

Huge wings blotting out the sun
Remembering everyone

Be so hard to look away
You've gotta be strong in the face of suffering
Cut a good figure just in case somebody's watching
Even if it ends up meaning nothing
Let the breezes spread such scandal as they may
Maybe Boris Vallejo paints the back of your head someday
Make it real
You make a deal
Until my protector comes
============================================================
In Memory of Satan
============================================================
Got my paintbox out last night
Stayed up late and wrecked this place
Woke up on the floor again
Cellphone stuck to the side of my face

Dead space on the other end
Perfect howl of emptiness
Cast my gaze around the room
Someone needs to clean up this mess

Tape up the windows
Call in a favor from an old friend

Make some scratches on my floor
Crawl down on my hands and knees
In old movies people scream
Choking on their fists when they see shadows like these
But no one screams 'cause it's just me
Locked up in myself
Never gonna get free

Something sacred, something blue
Cannons in the harbor dawn
I crawled down here to dig for bones
One more season then I'm gone

Black drapes over the crosses
Call in a favor from an old friend
============================================================
In the Cane Fields
============================================================
I tasted the wet sugar on your lips
And it brought me alive
Songs blended unsurely
One another on the arms of the air
We looked around the living room
There was cool jazz on the stereo
The sound was clean and clear
I was ready to absorb you into myself
My jaw was hanging open
I got so hungry and I felt so drunk
I felt your muscles tighten and relax
And tighten and relax
And tighten and relax
And tighten
And then relax

I knew a Cuban guy who worked cutting cane when he was young, can you imagine it
He said that the tension that it bred in his back was enough to make you laugh
Bending and rising sixteen hours a day
We looked around the living room
Your sweating skin pressed on me and we were drowning
And I don't wanna hurt you anymore
============================================================
In the Craters on the Moon
============================================================
If the strain proves too much
Give up right away
If the light hurts your eyes
Stay in your room all day

When the room fills with smoke
Lie down on the floor
In the declining years
Of the long war

Well the blood’s in the water
And the shark’s gonna come
And we swim in the dark
Until our bodies are numb

Blind desert rats in the moonlight
Too far from shore
In the declining years
Of the long war

Empty room with a lightbulb
Where the phone starts to ring
Everybody gets nervous
Nobody says anything

The next day someone’s initials
Show up on the door
I think I’m gonna crack
Can’t live like this anymore

Ugly things in the darkness
Worse things in store
In the declining years
Of the long war
============================================================
In the Hidden Places
============================================================
Autumn came around like a drifter to an on-ramp
There were wet leaves floating in gutters full of rain
Took to walking barefoot around town
Melodies from gradeschool kicking in my brain

Saw you on the crosstown bus today
You were reading a magazine
I turned my face away
And I shut my eyes tight
Dreamed about the flowers that hide from the light
On dark hillsides in the hidden places

The brakes howled and the bus pulled up near my house
And I got off at the corner
Pulled my sleeves down over my hands, over my hands
And I wished I was someone else
And I wished it was warmer

And when I got home I thought about you
Like a desperate policeman searching for clues
And I almost passed out just then
And I shut my eyes again
Headed for the dark hillsides
In the hidden places
============================================================
In the Shadow of the Western Hills
============================================================
Spread out the old maps on the floor
Plot the course of the infection
Trace from its beginnings to the present
Is there no one here who's making this connection
Feral cats out by the trash cans
To the true believer everything's a sign
Scrape the pigments from the baseboards
In the shadow of the western hills
And paint my vision on my body
In the shadow of the western hills

Bleak rose-petaled sky in two dimensions
Black treeline a blade that cuts across it all
Can't seem to sleep or find my appetite
Since I got home from the hospital
Call up Rebecca, maybe try to explain
But she hangs up while I'm still talking, I walk out into the rain
Wander from the alley to the darkness
Sink down completely, leave no trace
Trapped beneath the surface of the ice again
Lie still with the moonlight on my face
Wait for the wolves to keep their promise
Listen for their footfalls on the snow
I can't hear things clearly to be honest
In the shadow of the western hills
He gets most healed that waits the longest
In the shadow of the western hills
============================================================
Incandescent Ruins
============================================================
Here inside the final diorama
Charting weather patterns for kicks
There are several fairly weighty problems
I'm pretty sure the simulation won't fix

Never any better at bottom
Than the signals I'm set up to receive
Choking on the blood of the androids
Wiping off my mouth on my sleeve

Shining on the inside, maybe
Shining on the inside, maybe

Somewhere in the monument garden
Suggestions of a tunnel to freedom
Everywhere the crack of the rifle
Never any guns when you need them

I got to test my chin on the concrete
It's the only way to be sure
Only the desperate ever make it to the exit
Only the brave and the pure

Shining on the inside, maybe
Shining on the inside, maybe

Shining like a deep sea creature
Only temporarily bearing the pressure

Sniffing at the walls of the maze
All the ancient rumors were true
You only see the jump cuts and the close-ups
You never get the aerial view

Content to maybe serve as an example
Set up a sign or two on the trail
There's a lot of things that can happen
All for the want of a nail

Shining on the inside, maybe
Shining on the inside, maybe

Indonesia
============================================================
The summer came in carrying spring in its mouth
Held it up for everyone to see
This is the time when all our plans and schemes
Melt down into listless anarchy
Historically, anyway, that's been the case
But this year there's a new pink sheen on your face

Like the color of a secret flower
That grows tall and moist and incorruptible
In Indonesia
Indonesia

The season tunneled forward, like a moth through grain
Its hunger was an all-consuming, mindless thing
And you slept for twelve to fourteen hours at a stretch
I wondered what the weather in the fall was gonna bring
And then you said you'd dreamt of cowboys that were zombies in disguise
Well, I knew fall was never coming, it was written on your eyes

Like a mist that hangs there in the air
On the mountainside where rare and nameless flowers grow
In Indonesia
Indonesia

Infidelity (Song)
============================================================
There was a twinkle in my eye
As we watched the fish swim by
We saw the water going in and out
And you knew what I was thinking about

We watched the water
We looked right through it
And I let my hand rest a minute on your stomach
Like there was nothing to it

Three of them hiding behind a rock
And I got too nervous to talk
With your wondrous form all stretched out
Right next to me as the fish swam about

We watched the water
We looked right through it
And I let my hand rest a minute on your stomach
Like there was nothing to it

The room heated up, the windows were closed
We heard the humming of the air hose
That ran into the tank and the fish swam in place
And I fixed my eyes on your beautiful face

We watched the water
We looked right through it
And I let my hand rest a minute on your stomach
Like there was nothing to it

Insurance Fraud Number 2
============================================================
Bag full of oily rags
Fifty cent lighter
Dreams of retirement in Cancun
Burning ever brighter
There's a lot of ways to make money in this world
But I can't recommend insurance fraud

Burned out shell of a Volkswagen
Blood stains on the driveway
Torn up Mercedes by the side of the highway
Big plans, big plans
Let me tell you something, sister
You will never get away with it

You were sitting in the recliner with the TV on
When you said something evil and then you were gone
Explosives in the water main
A blown fuse
College graduation photograph
Splashed all over the six o'clock news
I won't be cashing in your policy
'Til I find out what it is you're trying to do to me
============================================================
International Small Arms Traffic Blues
============================================================
My love is like a powder keg
My love is like a powder keg in the corner of an empty warehouse
Somewhere just outside of town
About to burn down

My love is like a Cuban plane
My love is like a Cuban plane flying from Havana
Up the Florida coast to the 'Glades
Soviet made

Our love is like the border between Greece and Albania
Our love is like the border between Greece and Albania
Trucks loaded down with weapons
Crossing over every night
Moon yellow and bright
There is a shortage in the blood supply
But there is no shortage of blood
The way I feel about you baby can't explain it
You got the best of my love

Isaiah 45:23
============================================================
If my prayer be not humble make it so
In these last hours if the Spirit waits in check help me let it go
And should my suffering double let me never love You less
Let every knee be bent, and every tongue confess

And I won't get better but someday I'll be free
'Cause I am not this body that imprisons me

I read the magazines somebody brought
Hold them to my failing eyes until my hands get hot
And when the nurse comes in to change my sheets and clothes
The pain begins to travel, dancing as it goes

And I won't get better but someday I'll be free
'Cause I am not this body that imprisons me

If my prayer goes unanswered that's alright
If my path fills with darkness and there is no sign of light
Let me praise You for the good times, let me hold Your banner high
Until the hills are flattened and the rivers all run dry

And I won't get better but someday I'll be free
'Cause I am not this body that imprisons me

Island Garden Song

I will sail to the far shore
And I will chop a hole in the hull too big to repair
And I will turn the soil with my hands
And I will make my home there
My garden will grow so high
My garden will grow so high
That I will be completely hidden

I will go where I will go
And I will jettison all dead weight
And I will use these words for kindling
And I will sleep by the garden gate
My garden will grow so high
My garden will grow so high
That I will be completely hidden

It's All Here in Brownsville
============================================================
Meanwhile out where nothing starts
Out where the rail yard ends
The sun up above us is trying to kill himself
We were watching the skies again

Why do we come down to Brownsville
Year after year after year
This was the question we never even posed
Ringing like a siren in our ears

Down on the Mexican border
In the unfathomable heat
With our shirts tied around our waists
And the world at our feet

We looked at one another's bodies
Figured we looked all right
Ready to die if we had to
Watching the skies all night

And I was sure my heart would break
When the sun sank down into California
I felt your breath on my neck, it was hot and good and pure
And I wanted to warn you

It's all coming apart again
It's all coming apart again
It's all coming apart again
It's all coming apart again

I saw you in the blazing light
When the lotus caught fire
In the middle of the night
It froze me

I saw you coming closer real slow
You grabbed hold
I let go
Yeah I saw you in the blazing light
I saw you
I saw you alright
It froze me
It froze me
It froze me
It froze me

I know he's coming, let him come

Let the big big rabbit come out
Let the big big rabbit come down
Let him cast his shadow on the bright face of our little house
Let him dance through the garden
Let him come

It's getting darker, as the sky grows colder
And I feel your hand on my naked shoulder
Praise God I know you're with me, I know you're here
I can feel you breathing, I know you're near me okay

Let the big big rabbit come out
Let the big big rabbit come down
Let him cast his shadow on the bright face of our little house
Let him dance through the garden
Let him come

Jaipur
============================================================
I was having visions of sugared pastry
Cooked up in clarified butter
I tried to turn my visions into prayers
But I built my castle way high up in the air
Yeah I came to the gates of the fabled pink city
Hungry and tired and cold
Swing low, sweet chariot
Chrome tailpipe shining bright as spun gold

My brothers picked me up out of the rushes
Handed me into the company of evil men
But I've inched my way down the eastern seaboard
I am coming to Atlanta again
Yeah I came to the gates of the fabled pink city
Hungry and tired and mad as all hell
Swing low, sweet jewel-encrusted chariot
Make me young again
Make me well

I am the killer dressed in pilgrim's clothing
I'm the hard to find stations on the AM band
I am the white sky high over Tripoli
I am the landmine hidden in the sand

Yeah I came to the gates of the fabled pink city
Hungry and tired and alone
Sweet low, sweet, sweet, sweet chariot
Coming forth to carry me home

Jam Eater Blues (Song)
============================================================
Life is too short to refrain from eating jam out of the jar
Life is too short to refrain from eating jam out of the jar
And life is too short to wait around for you to come home tonight
Life is too short, too short to do that

Life is too short to leave the windows open all winter long
Life is too short to leave the windows open all winter long
I'm gonna lock 'em up tight and eat jam out of the jar all night
'Cause life is too short to make toast, or use spoons or napkins

Life is too short to spend the rest of it down here in Tampa
Life is too short to spend the rest of it down here in Tampa
Yeah, life is too short to let it go to waste like this
But I've never tasted jam before that tastes like this
And life is too short to refrain from eating jam out of the jar

Hey, I'm totally in the full heat of this one, so I haven't bothered to tune, so I'm not at 440 here. I don't know what to tell you. I'm in G, anyway, if anybody's taking notes. "January 31, 438."

When the hunger turns in on itself
It begins to devour its host
Who do you turn to for help?
Who do you love the most?

I dance with the ones that brought me
I dance with the ones that brought me here

When the word comes down the wire that they're looking
To make an example of you
Skin and bones around a campfire beneath the stars
No good end in view

I dance with the ones that brought me
I dance with the ones that brought me here

I dance in the dark, all alone
I dance for the god on the throne
If they come catch me and arrest me, mid-step
Let me go down dancing, let me be the last one left

Crushed like a sea shell by a seaside warrior's foot
Trying to turn the tide
When the hunger's all that holds you together
Who do you want by your side?

I dance with the ones that brought me, yeah
I dance with the ones that brought me here

Jay Gould's Daughter
============================================================
On a Monday morning it begin to rain
'Round the bend come a passenger train
On the bumpers there was a hobo John
He's a good old hobo but he's dead and gone
Dead and gone, dead and gone
He's a good old hobo but he's dead and gone

Jay Gould's daughter said before she died
Father, fix the blinds so the bums can't ride
If ride they must, let 'em ride the rod
Let 'em put their trust in the hands of God
Hands of God, hands of God
Let 'em put their trust in the hands of God

Now Jay Gould's daughter said before she died
There's one more road I'd like to ride
"Tell me, daughter, what can it be?"
It's in western Texas on the Santa Fe
Santa Fe, Santa Fe
It's in western Texas on the Santa Fe

Jeff Davis County Blues
============================================================
After three nights in jail, I head north from Toyahvale
Switch to 285 in Pecos, head up to Red Bluff
My walk's real steady and my eyes are real cold
But I feel like I'm all of sixteen years old
Lost in the Travelodge, with the television on with the sound down
I don't feel so tough
Old issues of Sunset magazine to read
Sleep for twelve hours, and dream about home

I have no place to go, so I drive up to New Mexico
Fix my eyes in the rearview when I cross the state line
And I panic, I guess. and although it's quite late
I take the first exit to 128
I am coming back to Midland, I hope you won't mind
Polaroids of the two of us scattered on the passenger's seat
I drive slowly
And evenly
And I dream about home

Jenny
============================================================
you roared into the driveway of our southwestern ranch-style house
on a new Kawasaki, all yellow and black
fresh out of the showroom.
our house faced west,
so the big orange sun positioned at your back,
lit up your magnificent silhouette.
how much better?
how much better can my life get?
900 cubic centimeters of raw whining power.
no outstanding warrants for my arrest.
whoa-whoa. whoa whoa.
the pirate's life for me.

I hopped on back of the bike, wrapped my arms around you.
and I sank my face into your hair.
and then I inhaled as deeply as I possibly could.
you were as sweet and delicious as the warm desert air.
and you pointed your headlamp toward the horizon,
we were the one thing in the galaxy god didn't have his eyes on.
900 cc's of raw whining power,
no outstanding warrants for my arrest.
hi diddle dee dee.
god damn!

Jenny was a warrior, Jenny was a thief
Jenny hit the corner clinic begging for relief
Never thought we'd see the day when she wiggled free
But she did
Long before we did

Nights in crackling emerald
Signal hot and live
Fastest in production
As of 1985

Didn't guess we'd ever come to dread that engine's roar
But she did
Long before we did

Nobody will ever know for certain
The names of all the secrets
She held back behind the curtain

Jenny came to get me
She'd been gone for several years
Aging motorcycles purr like cats when they grow near
I was crying, I could barely make the frame out
through my tears
She did
Long before we did
She did
Long before we did
Jenny, you did
Long before I did

there was a gas leak on a surface street somewhere
and we were stuck in traffic
and so i ran my fingers thorough your hair.
and the sun beat down through the windshield.
can you remember the heat?
and the taste of your tongue was thick and pure and impossibly sweet.
and the fields are white unto harvest.
the fields are white unto harvest now.
the fields are white unto harvest.
the fields are white unto harvest now.

the light turned red then green then yellow then red then green again
and i felt that shivering rippling feeling go through my spleen again.
and you leaned toward me.
and your sweat fell on my shoulder.
and i'm swimming back to that moment now before i get any older.
because the fields are white unto harvest.
the fields are white unto harvest now.
the fields are white unto harvest.
the fields are white unto harvest now.

Jungle Mercies
============================================================
I saw that hawk
And I saw that rabbit
In the ditch underneath its great gold claw
And it made me hungry
And I thought about you
How they'd finally wired your jaw shut

And I drove on home
Slow and steady
Found the driveway, spilled out from the car
Got out a sketchpad
And drew up a map
Showing the distance from here to the place where you are
And there will be tears
At the final judgment
And I will come by with my wrecking crew
And there will be tears
When the trumpets are sounding
Jungle mercies, jungle mercies
For me and you

Just a Closer Walk with Thee
============================================================
Just a closer walk with thee
Grant it, Jesus, if you please
Daily walking close to thee
Let it be, oh Lord, let it be

In this world of toils and snares
If I fall, oh Lord, who cares?
Who with me my burden shares?
None but Thee, dear Lord, none but Thee.

Just a closer walk with thee
Grant it, Jesus, if you please
Daily walking close to thee
Let it be, oh Lord, let it be

When my troubled life is o’er
Time for me will be no more
Then guide me gently, safely on
To thy shore, oh Lord, to thy shore

Just a closer walk with thee
Grant it, Jesus, if you please
Daily walking close to thee
Let it be, oh Lord, let it be

Daily walking close to thee
Let it be, oh Lord, let it be

Keep It on Your Mind
============================================================
(It's a quarter til 2 on the 23rd of February and this is a Hank Williams song)

Now if you stay out
And start playing around
Your baby's gonna burn your playhouse down
You better keep it on your mind
You better keep it on your mind
You'll be a-moanin' and a-groanin'
Lord, you better keep it on your mind

Now wrong is wrong
And right is right
If you make a pig mad
He's sure gonna bite
You better keep it on your mind
You better keep it on your mind
I've had it proven to me
Lord, you better keep it on your mind

Every fuss got the same old end
I don't believe the good lord
Meant for a man to win
You better keep it on your mind
You better keep it on your mind
You'll be a-groanin' and a-hoppin'
Lord, you better keep it on your mind

Now if she gets mad
And tells you goodbye
There's not a thing that you can do
But sit at home and cry
You better keep it on your mind
You better keep it on your mind
You better call her sweet mamma
Lord, you better keep it on your mind

Keeping House
============================================================
You clean out your junk-drawer, you mop up some blood
While the first of the new creatures rises from the mud
Cursing the moment that saw him draw breath
The ghost on your doorstep is starving to death

You spray down the windows, you wipe them all clean
And you douse your old clothing with fresh gasoline
And the ghost on your doorstep is soaked wet with rain
And he clutches his stomach and howls at the pain

And you can stay busy all day
He’s never going away

So let all the lights blaze, keep your heart light
Play really loud music all hours of the night
And when you set the table, set it for two
The ghost on your doorstep has to eat, same as you
Same as you

Kittens in Mittens
============================================================
The building shook with the sound of wild kittens
And I grabbed my scarf and I pulled on my mittens
Took my coat and I went down
To the useless lot on the outskirts of town
The dogs were howling
The wind was blowing
The birds were singing
And I saw you

Your eyes as bright as burning coals
But ask not for whom the bell tolls
'Cause it tolls for those who ask that question
And it tolls for those who answer that question
Dogs were howling
The birds were singing
The wind was blowing
And I saw you

Korean Bird Paintings

Yesterday I put in a good five hours
Talking to the statues
Chased your memory all around the room
Didn't manage to catch you
But I cleaned out the savings account
Blew everything I had on flowers and I
Covered up the furniture in carnations
Rolled around for hours
And there are those of you who've got the wrong idea right now
But man, you should've seen me when I got through
Indistinguishable from a fourth century Briton
Waiting on the couch for you

And I put all the extras on the credit card
Mobiles of the galaxy and mylar balloons
Everything we'd saved up in one room at the same time
Cartoon stars and crescent moons
Thank you notes and get-well cards
Condolences, congratulations
Bright colors, hues and signals
Reminders and reverberations

I saw you. I saw your hair
I could spend the rest of my life in there

I saw you and I sank into your eyes
I'm not going to apologize

Because you with your own hands
Made the whole world
You can't fool me
I'm on to you now

Because you with your own hands
Created everything
You can't fool me
I'm on to you now

Yeah, I saw you, but you saw me first
Living water to quench my thirst
And you tell me quiet down
But I have no doubt
I know what you're all about

Because you, with your own hands
Made the whole world
You can't fool me
I'm on to you now

Because you, with your own hands
Created everything
You can't fool me any more
I'm on to you now

A dream in switchgrass and concrete
Three gray floors of smoky windows
Facing the street

Michael pulls the blinds back up
Stares blankly down at the intersection
Watching for the guy who's got the angel dust
Crystal clear connection

Days like dominoes
All in a line
We cheer for the home team every time
lakeside view, lakeside view
lakeside view for my whole crew

Most nights now sleep in the kitchen
Keep my face cool on the floor
And John, John comes by to drop off his envelopes
Still playing postman after all these years

Pull down my army surplus jacket
Dig through some drawers to find the keys
Emerge transformed in a million years
From days like these

Under each eye little greasepaint smudge
You can't judge us - you're not the judge
lakeside view, lakeside view
lakeside view for my whole crew

And just before I leave
I throw up in the sink
One whole life recorded
In disappearing ink

And Ray left a message thumbtacked to the door
I don't even bother trying to read them anymore
lakeside view,
lakeside view,
lakeside view for my whole crew

Larry's Girl
============================================================
Bend over, bitch, and whinny.
Lift that tail.
That heavenly horse-ass
will never fail me.
============================================================
Last Gasp at Calama
============================================================
Out in the street
Free and young
Songs of the Great God
Wild on my tongue
Here come the new guys again
Humorless men
Let he who's without sin
Throw the first one, like you said
Let anyone else throw the second
As long as it connects with your head

One summer, then all of this is gone
One more summer, then no more swan

Hand me a torch why not
Let's get some kicks in while the flame's still hot
They'll do what they were gonna do anyway
But Carthage may rise again one day
"With the measure that you used, so shall it be measured to you,"
So you say, and it's true

One summer, then all of this is gone
One more summer, then no more swan
============================================================
Last Man on Earth
============================================================
Just when the last of the smoke subsides you'll see my fingers
Hoisting my body up atop the charred debris
Who is that creature with the crazed look in his eyes?
Don't even question your senses
You can be sure that's me
When all the pretenders to your hand lie dead across the land,
I'll be the last man on earth
I'll be the last man on earth
I'll be the last man on earth
Crawling around, down on the ground

When the Hail Marys you've been saying lose their savor
Just when your dungeon walls feel like they're closing in
Whose are those bloody knuckles reaching down to grab you
Just as the last of the light overhead is growing dim?
It was their love you wanted, not mine
But when they deny your name three times
I'll be the last man on earth
I'll be the last man on earth
I'll be the last man on earth
Crawling around, down on the ground

And I will throw you across my shoulders
And I will bleed and I will drool
And the cameras will slow pan across my face
And I will try to say something cool

Just as the hoardes of thirsting demons close around us
Raising their axes, howling like monkeys in the sun
Who will that guy be holding you so high above them?
You know and I know, everyone knows it, I'm the one
I may have failed you once before
But this right here, this means war
I'll be the last man on earth
I'll be the last man on earth
I'll be the last man on earth
Crawling around, down on the ground
============================================================
Leaving Home
============================================================
We gathered up our worldly goods
Stole off in the dawn as quickly as we could
You were quieting the baby down
When we came to the dock on the outskirts of town
And looking back we saw China
Shrinking to the size of a coin
And then we saw water everywhere

When we climbed on board
They tied our things together with electrical cord
And then we set sail
As we held on tight to the cold iron rail
And I apologize but I don't know what I love more
You next to me there or the receding shore
We stood there in the cold
And the baby was six months old
We were passing him back and forth
When a cold familiar wind came down from the north
And looking back we saw China
Shrinking to the size of a coin
And then we saw water everywhere
============================================================
Leisure Days
============================================================
It's best to see your open wound.
Fresh gash bleeding.
Severed green and blue.
Your open wound.
============================================================
Lemon
============================================================
If you cut a lemon in half
You'll have two distinct pieces
Each one representing
One half of a lemon
Yet now,
Its not so much of a lemon
As it is two distinct pieces
Of that lemon
Licking the lemon juice off the knife
Is dangerous
Imagine cutting the corner of your mouth
And then lemon juice
Ouch
But you already know that the knife
had little, if anything, to do
With creating two distinct pieces
Of that lemon
Sure, the rind and the pulp
Were split by serrated metal
(The wooden handle a little loose from when Dad
did the funny thing with his teeth)
============================================================
Let Me Bathe in Demonic Light
============================================================
Down at the end of a bombed-out street
The shell of a house where my friends and me used to meet
Someday the old flesh will give way to the new
Find a functioning mirror inside and slip right through

And there, there I’ll be
And who, who’s coming with me?
To show me my one true face
When I arrive at my preordained place

Chain of command maybe ten years long
I emerge in Manhattan, still young and strong
Someday the hellhound will pick up the scent on the trail
Zero in on my penthouse and then pierce the veil

And there, there I’ll be
And who, who’s coming with me?
To show me my one true face
When I arrive at my preordained place

Hopeless but free
Lit up like a marquee
Shining over the freeway
Where will my long trail end?
Here, here with my new friend

Fruits of the spirit heavy on the vine
Undying hunger deep in the bloodline
Dodge the hook like a steelhead
Swim right through the night
Break the surface and rise like a geyser
When my time is right

There, there I’ll be
And who, who among you
Who’s coming with me?
To show me my one true face
When I arrive at my preordained place
============================================================
Let Me Go
============================================================
Let me stay for half the season
Let me find a place where I can lie low
Let me catch a flight out to some island somewhere
Let me go
Let me go where my pictures go

Let me leave my things down at the clinic
Unwrap my bandages and drop,
Drop them in the water
Let me feel the soft spray splashing at my face
And lead us on our leisures like lambs down to the slaughter
Blow the fire, lick lips, and let the flames eradicate our limbs
============================================================
Let the Dogs Come Out
============================================================
New rivers forming on the surface of the world
I mean to say that it's raining
Otis Redding tried to tell me there'd be days like this
But I didn't believe him
Yeah Otis Redding talked about this kind of thing
When I'm only semi-conscious and I hear the phone ring

Let the dogs come out
I'm ready now
Let the dogs come out
I'm ready now

And I remember where I was the last time that it rained like this
And I remember where I was the last time it was raining this hard
And do you remember where I was
And I know that you remember where we were last time it rained like this

Let the dogs come out
I'm ready now
Let the dogs come out
I'm ready now

Letter from Belgium
============================================================
Martin calls to say he's sending old electrical equipment
That's good: we can always use some more electrical equipment

In the cold clear light of day down here
Everyone's a monster
That's cool with all of us
We've been past the point of help since early April

Susan and her notebook
Freehand drawings of Lon Chaney
Blueprints for geodesic domes
Recipes for cake

Yeah we're all here
Chewing our tongues off
Waiting for the fever to break

When we walk out in the sunlight we tell everyone we know it hurts our eyes
When the real reason we don't like it is that it makes us wonder if we're dying

And Martin's found an old trunk full of stage makeup in the basement
And he's sending it along, we can always use more makeup
Yeah, more creams and powders

And Carrie's got the feeling
That the people next door
Will close in like a wolf pack
Should we make one small mistake

Yeah we're all here
Chewing our tongues off
Waiting for the fever to break
============================================================
Letter from a Motel
============================================================
The beams we used to build our house are breaking at last
The building will not hold together very much longer
My arms are young and they can do the work if called upon to do so
But the house itself has weakened and it's tilting on its axis

In the picture that you sent I could see the windows getting soft
Yeah I could see the heat had gotten straight out of hand
And I knew that none of this was what you'd been meaning to send along
I did not mean to say what I'm saying now
if we're gonna talk about what intentions were
But the house itself is weak.
Very weak.
Though you and our three daughters believe in what you want to believe
From where I stand stability is everything
In the room I'm standing in stability is everything
And in this world, in this world, stability is everything
============================================================
Lie Down, Keep Still, Play Dead
============================================================
Play dead, wait for the demon legion to come
Opening out onto the clearing, eating up your trail of crumbs
Keep silent, when they throw their heads back and sing
Anathematic melodies, just a message from the king

Lie down, keep still, play dead
Lie down, keep still, play dead

Shadow breathing as the howling modulates
It is for these songs that the rosy dawn awaits
And when the dawn arrives, all of you will run for your lives
Corpse pose down in the dry leaves alone,
Harmonics of the chasm, proclamations on the throne

Lie down, keep still, play dead
Lie down, keep still, play dead
============================================================
Like a Bullet
============================================================
The car wouldn't start
And I had to walk
I headed out Arrow toward the Western Rock
And I looked through the fence
Heavy machinery shining in the moonlight
And a huge yellow tractor caught my eye
I heard the wheels crunch the gravel, I was feeling alright

And the tractor spoke
In drawn out syllables
The tractor sang
In long full notes
I'm getting out of here
Coming to you like a bullet
I'm getting out of here
Coming to you like a bullet

You gave me that liquid laugh
When I got home
As I tried to describe the bright yellow body and the shining chrome come alive
I knew you'd laugh
But that particular tone of yours just cuts me in half
You don't know what it's like to hear a big dumb machine spell out the details of your life

And the tractor spoke to me
In drawn out syllables
The tractor sang
In long full notes
I'm getting out of here
Coming to you like a bullet
I'm getting out of here
Coming to you like a bullet
============================================================
Linda Blair Was Born Innocent
============================================================
Gentle hum of the old machines
Here we come scrubbed and scoured
Patches on our jeans
When the drone sounds
In the cool night wind
We pick up the call
Kick all the traces in
Hungry for love
Ready to drown
So tie down the sails
We're going downtown

Great big drain on the power grid
You may not like Tate's methods
But you've got to admit
She's a real nice kid
We walk light
Down the wires
Higher than weather balloons
Empty hearts on fire
Hungry for love
Ready to drown
So tie down the sails tonight
We're going downtown
============================================================
Lion's Teeth
============================================================
The king of the jungle
Was asleep in his car
When your chances fall in your lap like that
You've gotta recognize them for what they really are

Nobody in this house
Wants to own up to the truth
I crawl in shotgun and reach into his mouth
And grab hold of one long sharp tooth

And hold on
For dear life
I hold on

Well of course he wakes up
His paw hits the horn
I am gonna regret
The day that I was born

And then Mom
Rushes out to the driveway
My sister too
Everyone's screaming
I am dreaming of you

I hold on
For dear life
I hold on

And my arms get sore
And my palms start to sweat
And the tears roll down my face
'Til my cheeks are hot and red and soaking wet

In come the cops
They blowtorch the doors
I start wailing
The lion roars

There's no good way to end this
Anyone can see
There's this great big you
And little old me

And we hold on
For dear life
We hold on
We hold on
============================================================
Little Boxes
============================================================
Little boxes on the hillside
Little boxes made of ticky-tacky
Little boxes, little boxes
Little boxes all the same
There's a green one and a pink one
And a blue one and a yellow one
And they're all made out of ticky-tacky
And they all look just the same

And the people in the houses
All went to the university
Where they got put in boxes
And they came out all the same
And there's doctors and there's lawyers
And business executives
And they're all made out of ticky-tacky
And they all look just the same

And they all play on the golf course
And drink their martinis dry
And they all have pretty children
And the children go to school
And the children go to summer camp
And then to the university
Where they get put in boxes
And they come out all the same

And the boys go into business
And marry and raise a family
In boxes made of ticky-tacky
And they all look just the same
There's a green one and a pink one
And a blue one and a yellow one
And they're all made out of ticky-tacky
And they all look just the same

And they're all made out of ticky-tacky
And they all look just the same

Liza Forever Minnelli
============================================================
There's the part you've braced yourself
against and then there's the other part
Steal up inclining northward streets
with some weird sickness in the dark

Saw your name on the sidewalk
saw your brave face in my mind
If you're gonna sit next to the dealer
you get to bet blind

Never get away, never get away
I am never ever gonna get away
from this place
Lay down on the streets
my eyes toward the sun,
your star next to my face

The compasses I came into this world
with never really worked so good
Gentle shadows spilling down the hills
up on Mulholland at Ledgewood

Turn back turn back,
find someone to tell your secrets to
Dream past an old hotel on Ivar
and seconds later I saw you

Never get away, never get away
I am never ever gonna get away
from this place
Lay down on the streets
my eyes toward the sun,
your star next to my face

Let the camera track me
from the footlights to the wings
Let me set aside an hour or two
in memory of sweet things

Regrind the lens again and again
and again and again
but still the picture flips
Anyone here mentions "Hotel California"
dies before the first line
clears his lips

Never get away, never get away
I am never ever gonna get away
from this place
Lay down on the streets
my eyes toward the sun,
your star next to my face
============================================================
Lizard Suit
============================================================
Take the trouble to pronounce the street names right
People like it when you show respect
Look out the window at the softening asphalt
The dreamy shimmer of the haze effect

Wear my lizard suit to the party
It's so hard to get noticed in this town

Almost invisible aboard the train
So many people who you just can't read
Dawdle when I reach the final station
Don't make a move until the crowds recede

Wear my lizard suit to the party
It's so hard to get noticed in this town

Wait for my cue
Search for one clue
I have to trust that my compass stays true

Let my phobias control my habits
Let my habits form the shapes of days
All alone up on the rooftop sometimes
Among the beacons where the lightning plays

Wear my lizard suit to the party
It's so hard to get noticed in this town
============================================================
Lonesome Surprise
============================================================
Doctor, doctor
Can you help me please
All these pills and problems
Keep piling down on me

Here's your lonesome surprise
Here's your lonesome surprise
Here's your lonesome surprise

I had a name
Had a place
Like the clothes I wear
The holes grow everywhere
'Til it's like having nothing at all

Here's your lonesome surprise
Here's your lonesome surprise
Here's your lonesome surprise

Here's your lonesome surprise
Here's your lonesome surprise
Here's your lonesome surprise

Walked out of my shower
Feeling more wet than baptized
Here's your lonesome surprise
Here's your lonesome surprise

Here's your lonesome surprise
Here's your lonesome surprise
Here's your lonesome surprise
============================================================
Love Cuts the Strings
============================================================
First thing that happened was the river overflowed
The water running through the streets was sweet and cold
I knelt by the water like a doe by a stream
Punch-drunk, snowblind, as though the whole thing were a bad dream

And then love called out the heavy artillery
And Kypris took the horses by the bit for the morning ride
I count my blessings but you can only be expected to count so high
When love cuts the strings

I smeared myself with pennyroyal to keep the hounds at bay
And you poked your head out of an alley half a block away
And I recognized you though I'm not sure how
And the air turned red around you
As a dull chill came down over me

And then love summoned up the infantry
And the green-eyed goddess got ready for all-out war
I count my blessings
But I don't even know what the word blessing means
When love cuts the strings

Yeah!
============================================================
Love Hymn to Aphrodite
============================================================
(The actual date is the 17th of April. Love Hymn to Aphrodite)
The sunset gets a little longer every night
And it's no good but I feel alright
The sky turns orange and the colors start swirling
You float downstairs, your body spinning in perfect circles
It's the 18th of July
What what are you doing
============================================================
Love Love Love
============================================================
King Saul fell on his sword when it all went wrong
And Joseph's brother sold him down the river for a song
And Sonny Liston rubbed some tiger balm into his glove
Some things you do for money
And some you do for love love love

Raskolnikov felt sick and he couldn't say why
When he saw his face reflected in his victim's twinkling eye
Some things you'll do for money
Some you'll do for fun
But the things you do for love are gonna come back to you
One by one

Love, love is gonna lead you by the hand
Into a white and soundless place
Now we see things
As in a mirror dimly
Then we shall see each other
Face to face

And way out in Seattle, young Kurt Cobain
Snuck out to the greenhouse and put a bullet in his brain
Snakes in the grass beneath our feet
Rain in the clouds above
Some moments last forever
But some flare out with
Love love love
============================================================
Love and Marriage
============================================================
Love and marriage, love and marriage
It's an institute you can't disparage
Ask the local gentry
And they will say it's elementary

Try, try, try to separate them
It's an illusion
Try, try, try, and you will only come
To this conclusion
============================================================
Lovecraft in Brooklyn
============================================================
It's gonna be too hot to breathe today
But everybody is out here on the streets
Somebody's opened up the fire hydrant
Cold water rushing out in sheets

Some kid in a Marcus Allen jersey
Asks me for a cigarette
Companionship is where you find it
So I take what I can get

Hubcaps on the car like fun house mirrors
Stick to the shadows when I can
Lovecraft in Brooklyn

Well the sun goes down on the armies of the voiceless
Several hundred-thousand strong
Come without their bandages
Their voices raised in song

When the street lights sputter out
They make this awful sizzling sound
I cast my gaze towards the pavement
Too many blood stains on the ground

Rhode Island drops into the ocean
No place to call home anymore
Lovecraft in Brooklyn

Head outside most everyday
To try to keep the wolves away
Imagine nice things I might say
If company should come

Woke up afraid of my own shadow
Like, genuinely afraid
Headed for the pawnshop
To buy myself a switchblade

Someday something's coming
From way out beyond the stars
To kill us while we stand here
It'll store our brains in mason jars

And then the girl behind the counter
She asks me how I feel today
I feel like Lovecraft in Brooklyn

Yeah!
============================================================
Lucifer Rising
============================================================
Call me the running man
Call me Alachua County bill
Call me dripping water underneath the phosphor still
Call me John the Ripper tearing at your skin
One day I'll pay for this, for now
Just let me in

It's a straight walk home
It's a straight walk home
It's a straight walk home
Straight walk home
Through the generation fields
And the ventilation dome
Body after body, alone

Nix your dirty water
Forget your resource management skills
I crawl starving down
Sloping Colorado hills
Call me John the Ripper tearing at your skin
One day I'll pay for this, for now
Just let me in

It's a straight walk home
Straight walk home
Straight walk home
Straight walk home
Through the generation fields
And the ventilation dome
Body after body, alone

Lucretia My Reflection
============================================================
I hear the roar of a big machine
Two worlds and in between
Hot metal and methedrine
I hear empire down
I hear empire down

I hear the roar of a big machine
Two worlds and in between
Love lost, fire at will
Dum-dum bullets and shoot to kill, I hear
Dive, bombers, and
Empire down
Empire down

I hear the sons of the city and dispossessed
Get down, get undressed
Get pretty but you and me,
We got the kingdom, we got the key
We got the empire, now as then,
We don't doubt, we don't take direction,
Lucretia, my reflection, dance the ghost with me

We look hard
We look through
We look hard to see for real
Such things I hear, they don't make sense
I don't see much evidence
I don't feel
I don't feel
I don't Feel

A long train held up by page on page
A hard reign held up by rage
Once a railroad
Now it's done
Once a railroad
Now it's done

I hear the roar of a big machine
Two worlds and in between
Hot metal and methedrine
I hear empire down
We got the empire, now as then,
We don't doubt, we don't take reflection,
Lucretia, my direction, dance the ghost with me
============================================================
Luna
============================================================
All gone, all gone
Watching it go up out front on the lawn
Stay on my feet somehow
I’m strong now
Stuck there, no air

Head high, head high
Tongues of fire that reach up for the sky
Rise through the smoke
The dust of the grave
I will be saved

Pause in mid-stride
Pause in mid-stride
And ride, and ride, and ride, and ride

Burn hard, burn hard
Smoldering pieces landing in the yard
Trace names in ash
Big names, old friends
And dead ends

Those last few frames
Go down so fast
Rise through the flames and end again in flames at last

Stay free, stay free
Invisible armies march by night for me
Stay on my guard
Burn hard
Rage on
All gone

Pause in mid-stride
Pause in mid-stride
And ride and ride and ride and ride
============================================================
Magpie
============================================================
Feed the kittens in the kitchen
Set food out for the strays
Try hard to do your best
The magpie will have his way

Fill your mouth with berries
By the full light of the moon
Work all night if you have to
The magpie comes at noon

Shore up the crucifixes
Above the archways and the doors
The magpie will come at midday
And you will go down on all fours

And when the cherry's white with blossoms
Be ready and be brave
And remember what we had here
When there was something left to save
============================================================
Maize Stalk Drinking Blood
============================================================
Lying in the hot sun today
Watching the clouds run away
Thought a little while about you
The sky was a petrifying blue
And while the geese flew past
For no reason at all
I let the sky fall
This is an empty country, and I am the king
And I should not be allowed to touch anything

I picked myself up off the ground
Shook the grass from my hair and I
Walked around
Felt the warm sun in my eye
Strangers were passing by
I shinnied up the black walnut tree
Let the hard blue sky fall right through me
And I saw the sad young cardinals trying to sing
And I should not be allowed to touch anything
============================================================
Make You Suffer
============================================================
I'm going to rise up early every day
Overcome every obstacle in my way
Keep a secret chamber in my heart clean
Polish every surface to a brilliant sheen
Remain positive and stay on the grind
And banish every other thought from my mind

I'm going to make you suffer
I'm going to make you suffer
Let your yes be yes, and let your no come from deep in your belly
I'm going to make you suffer

There was a captain many years at sea
Living the life of the sailor, rugged and free
Nothing but the sky to sing him to sleep at night
Safe in the arms of the ocean - no land in sight
Out on the waves, you try to keep warm
Nobody here to sound the alarm

I'm going to make you suffer
I'm going to make you suffer
The first in line will receive the full brunt of the blow
I'm going to make you suffer

Woke up from a dream whimpering like an infant
Over time people tell me their dreams grow distant
And they learn to love the lives they lead
No more hungry ghosts in the chimney to feed
You often hear stories like these
Someday I will see you on your knees

I'm going to make you suffer
I'm going to make you suffer
Say what you like, there won't be anybody listening
I'm going to make you suffer
============================================================
Malevolent Cityscape X
============================================================
The street's alive
And we're not alone
Our limbs move like well-oiled gears
And I know we're never going home
There is a dwarf on the corner
With a cup in his hand
A black hat on his big head
He sings a little song and then the sky turns red

And just now
When I catch sight of you
In the burning sun
You strike me as mean-spirited

If they wanna come out
Let the old songs come
The scales can track
And the arpeggiates can run
Once I knew what to say to you but
Now the words will not come through
And I love you underneath the red sky
But for the life of me I couldn't say why

And just now
When I catch sight of you
In the burning sun
You strike me as mean-spirited
============================================================
Malevolent Seascape Y
============================================================
We saw the ship meet the horizon
We saw it carry him away
And the streamers on the hull were the last things to wink out of existence
As a light breeze came in from across the bay
You dug around in the sand
You came up holding something
And when you handed it over with that smile on your face
I knew the three of us meant less than nothing
I held the seashell next to my ears, but I didn't hear anything
I held the seashell next to my ear, but I didn't hear anything

The dogfish swam beneath the jetty
Where our legs hung down
And the ocean hugged the sun with her long arms
As the lights came up above Chinatown
I guess this makes it all easier
I guess it's smooth sailing now
I guess this irons out all the wrinkles from the fabric
I guess it never really mattered anyhow
I held the seashell next to my ear, but I didn't hear anything
I held the seashell next to my ear, but I didn't hear anything

Malted Milk
============================================================
Two weeks later
You ask me what did I do?
Right after I got the great big [brush? off from you.
And I checked my pulse
And I caught my breath
And I, I guess you know what happens next.

I sat down and I drank my malted milk. [x2

You, you say
You say I'm easily appeased.
But you, you don't know
The feeling that shoots through me
With a tall glass of malted milk.
Cold as ice, smooth as silk.
I sit down and I try real hard to forget
That you, you and I
Ever met.

Yesterday,
You came over,
And you found me stretched out on the sofa.
And you said you were gonna call a medic
Cuz I looked so pathetic,
Lying there,
Smiling brightly,
Staring at you.
Malted milk in my hand, still as a statue.

I sat down and I drank my malted milk. [x4

Marduk T-Shirt Men's Room Incident
============================================================
Slumped up against the sink
Hair plastered to her cheeks
Marduk t-shirt sticking to her skin
Refugee from a disco in old east Berlin

Weightless, formless, blameless, nameless

Stray syllables were gurgling
From her throat one at a time
Face hidden from my view
I let myself imagine she was you

Only weightless, formless, blameless, nameless

And when I washed my hands
I ran the water hotter than I could stand
Half rising to a crouch
Sinking back down to the floor
When you’re walking keep your head low
Try to leave no traces when you go

Stay weightless, formless, blameless, nameless

Mark On You
============================================================
When this is over
When we leave this all behind us
Deep in the moonless night
When the rescue team finds us

It's gonna get so dark for you
I'm gonna leave a mark on you
I'm gonna leave a mark on you

Can't trust anybody
Even the tough ones crack
Train up a swordsman
To stab you in the back
I know this much is true
I'm gonna leave a mark on you

No man knows the hour or the day
But the mark is gonna be visible
From several blocks away

Maybe you'll make it
To the far side of the hill
Maybe you will see me coming
But I don't think you will
Make peace with your family
You walk softly on this earth

I'm gonna leave a mark on you
I'm gonna leave a mark on you
I'm gonna leave a mark on you
I'm gonna leave a mark on you

Marsh Witch Vision
============================================================
Break into shining storefronts up and down the avenue
Do six months for burglary, get a fresh tattoo
Dad buys a PA system, I invite some friends around
Just some guys I know from town
All the normal things to do down here just bore me
What is this I see before me

Take a job up at the slaughterhouse, hammer in hand
Happy on the weekends singing with my band
And then one day we’re bound for Denmark
One change of clothes in tow
So let’s go
When the spirit moves within you, how can you resist the call
I love you all
============================================================
Masher
============================================================
Most of the brine has gotta boil away
Most of the air has gotta choke you
Most of June I spent in jail again
I don't mean jail exactly
Up in the pine tree
A red squirrel looking down at me
I am losing control of the language again
I am losing control of the language again

Most of the things I used to hold on to
Most of the things I used to say to you
Most of the ways I knew around the local roads
Are disappearing daily
High in the cottonwood
You were looking down at me and you sure looked good
Hair hanging down in the leaves
Neck tilted back to make a rainbow
I was losing control of the language again
I am losing control of the language again
============================================================
Matthew 11:14-19
============================================================
He who casts the stone can't ever do so on his own
It takes a crowd to drown a witch
So he said to us when he wriggled free and got the gun from me
Standing before us, his cracking voice rising in pitch

And then the blood that's been spilling from his eyes
Soaks through the bandages that are wrapped around his face
And just before he walks backwards through the wall
He pivots 45 degrees to face us all
And he says
"Let him who has eyes to see
Take a good look at me
I'm a Mylar sheet hanging in the sun"

Claude Rains in all his glory
Is not arrayed like these
Who have come to walk before us
Rising from their knees
Fighting back against their captors
Calling down the curse
Like this man whose substance is malleable
Screaming out chapter and verse

And then the blood
That's been spilling from his eyes
Soaks through the bandages that are wrapped around his face
And just before he walks backwards through the wall
He pivots 45 degrees to face us all
And he says
"Let him who has eyes to see
Take a good look at me
I'm a Mylar sheet hanging in the sun"
============================================================
Matthew 25:21
============================================================
They'd hooked you up
To a fentanyl drip
To mitigate the pain a little bit
I flew in
From Pennsylvania
When I heard the hour was coming fast
And I docked in Santa Barbara
Tried to brace myself
But you can't brace yourself
When the time comes
You just have to roll with the blast
And I'm an eighteen-wheeler headed down the interstate
And my brakes are going to give
And I won't know till it's too late
Tires screaming when I lose control
Try not to hurt too many people when I roll

Find the harbor freeway
And head south
Real tired
Head kind of light
I found Telegraph Road
I'd only seen the name on envelopes
Found the parking lot
And turned right
I felt all the details
Carving out space in my head
Tropicanas on the walk way
Neon red
Between the pain
And the pills trying to hold it at bay
Stands a traveler going somewhere far away
And I am an airplane tumbling wing over wing
Tried to listen to my instruments
They don't say anything
People screaming when the engines quit
I hope we're all in crash position when we hit

And then came to your bedside
And as it turns out
I'm not ready
And as though
You were speaking through a thick haze
You said hello to me
We all stood there around you
Happy to hear you speak
The last of something bright burning
Still burning
Beyond the cancer and the chemotherapy
And you were a presence full of light upon this earth
And I am a witness to your life and to its worth
It's three days later when I get the call
And there's nobody around to break my fall
============================================================
Maybe Sprout Wings
============================================================
A bad dream shook me in my sleep
And I woke up sweating
Ran through the dark to the shower
Already forgetting

Try to think good thoughts
Trying to find my way clear
Let the room fill with steam
Traced pictures on the mirror

Ghosts and clouds
And nameless things
Squint your eyes and hope real hard
Maybe sprout wings

I clawed my way to the living room window
Stood there in the cold
The last bits of my dream like figures in the distance
Hard to hold

I thought of old friends
the ones who'd gone missing
Said all their names three times
Phantoms in the early dark
Canaries in the mines

Ghosts and clouds
And nameless things
Squint your eyes and hope real hard
Maybe sprout wings
============================================================
Memories

Frankie Lane, he was singing "Jezebel"
I pinned an iron cross to my lapel
I walked up to the tallest and the blondest girl
I said, look, you don't know me now, but very soon you will
So won't you let me see
I said won't you let me see
I said won't you let me see
Your naked body

Just dance me to the dark side of the gym
Chances are I'll let you do most anything
She said I know you're hungry, I can hear it in your voice
And there are many parts of me to touch, you have your choice
But no you cannot see
She said no you cannot see
She said no you cannot see
My naked body

So we're dancing close, the band is playing "Stardust"
Balloons and paper streamers, they're floating down on us
She said you've got a minute left to fall in love
In solemn moments such as this I have put my trust
And all my faith to see
I said all my faith to see
I said all my faith to see
Her naked body
============================================================
Merry Christmas from the Family
============================================================
Mom got drunk and dad got drunk
At our Christmas party
We were drinking champagne punch and homemade eggnog
Little sister brought her new boyfriend
He was a Mexican
We didn't know what to think of him 'til he sang
Feliz Navidad, Feliz Navidad

Carve the turkey, turn the ballgame on
Make margaritas 'cause we all want one
Send somebody to the Quickpak store
We need some ice and an extension chord
A can of bean dip and some Diet Rite
A box of tampons and some Marlboro Lights, well
Hallelujah everybody say cheese
Merry Christmas from the family

Fred and Rita drove from Harlingen
I don't remember how I'm kin to them
But when they tried to plug their motor home in they
Blew our Christmas lights
Cousin David knew just what went wrong
So we all waited out on our front lawn
He threw the breaker and the lights all came on
And we sang Silent Night, oh Silent Night

Carve the turkey, turn the ballgame on
Make Bloody Marys when the eggnog's gone
Send somebody to the QuickPak store
We need some ice and an extension chord
A can of bean dip and some Diet Sprite
A box of tampons, and some Marlboro Lights well
Hallelujah everybody say cheese yeah
Merry Christmas from the family
Feliz Navidad

I am ready for my close up today
Too long I’ve let my self-respect stand in my way
Well the prom queen's caught in the high beams
And the strings keen, it’s a big scene

But when the house goes up in flames
No one emerges triumphantly from it
When the scum begins to circle the drain
Everybody loves a winner

I spent eight hours in my make-up chair
Waxed my chest and shaved off all my hair
Well the fire's bright and the frame's tight
Try to get right—Well, we’ve still got light

But when the house goes up in flames
No one emerges triumphantly from it
When the scum begins to circle the drain
Everybody loves a winner

Midland
============================================================
Come and stay with me as long as you like
I live outside of town where the straight highway curves
For three years I lived next door to the airport
So nothing you can say to me can get on my nerves
Stay 'til you feel your legs underneath you again
I've got room in my house for you

I've got a Kenmore single-room window unit air conditioner
It cools down the place in the full heat of day
And a family of possums that've made their home underneath the front steps
They are majestic in their own beady-eyed, homely way
Stay 'til you can breathe like normal people do
I've got room in my house for you

They tore down the airport in 1981
This is where I came when I ran out of places to run
Come, come, come and stay with me, out here away from things
Come and stay with me where the sky's real clear
I live way out where no one believes anybody could live
The sky out is purple from six in the evening 'til midnight out here
Stay 'til the world goes down in flames
I've got room, room in my house for you
============================================================
Milk Song
============================================================
When the sky was the color of cream
And you started leaving messages on my answering machine
Telling me that you were way across town and would
Be home in a night or two
I started keeping track of my losses
There were only one or two I couldn't cover
And up there against the milk white sky I saw
Fleeting vestiges of you

But the way you vanished gradually
Has made a bitter man of me
Yeah the way you vanished gradually
Has made a bitter man of me

Where the ocean cleaves the rocks real clean
I dropped my answering machine
I watched the waves chew it into tiny little pieces
Saw the sea foam hissing in the air
In the balance sheet I'd been keeping in my mind I entered
Two hundred kroners to the left of the debit line
It was what the machine had cost me
It was a greater loss than I could bear
I hear the wheels and knobs whirring down to this very day
Long after the ocean has washed it all away
I heard the train go by last night
And it's a slow train out of here alright

But the way you disappeared in slow degrees
Has made a very patient man of me, yeah
============================================================
Milkcrate
============================================================
All I got is a pool key, but it lets me in
To the place where the surface of the water breaks its contract with the skin
And you can twist it cruelly, like a lime in gin
But I've been leaving my screen door open halfway hoping you'd drop in

And all the clothes in this milkcrate, they're yours for good
We can take them out to your truck and we can lean against the hood
And you can tell me it's still great to come by and chat
But I'm not completely convinced that you're willing to leave it at that

So let's sit down, take off our shoes
Let's not misuse the time from noon 'til two
And let's lie down, take off our clothes
And just suppose that there's no starting over to do
There's no starting over to do
There's no, there's no starting over

An army of lovers can be beaten
Have you ever tried to defeat just one
Straighten the pillows while I neaten up the edges of this mattress
Where our struggle's just begun

So let's sit down, take off our shoes
Let's not misuse the time from noon 'til two
And let's lie down, take off our clothes
And just suppose that there's no starting over to do
There's no starting over to do
There's no, there's no starting over

Million
============================================================
When I came back from Finland
And the taxi took me down the street
I saw the red flowers growing like they used to by the roadside
In the smothering summer heat

You were standing out in front of the house
With your floral print dress on
And you had questions only a masochist would ask
Written all over your big brown eyes
The moon is high over Iowa at night
And the moon is high over Iowa at night
And I brought you a blanket
Handwoven, hand-dyed
The moon is high over Iowa at night
============================================================
Minnesota
============================================================
Seeds came in the mail today from Holland
And the language on the package is wonderful and strange
All sorts of flowers that grow up from the earth
In goodly colors gloriously arranged
I circled the house and I scattered them around
Let the water sink down into the soil
Stared a long time at the residue
Blood, milk and oil
God the humidity is something
Our shirts are soaked clean through
The house is throbbing and the heat keeps coming
And I keep looking at you

And then you're singing in Dutch to me
And I recognize the song
It seems so old and so fragile
And I haven't heard it in so long
We may throw the windows open later
But we are not as far west as you suppose we are
Hot wind coming off the water
Sky gone crazy with stars
While we stay here we imagine we're alive
We see shadows on the walls
There's something waiting for us in the hot, wet air
Sweat, water and alcohol
Just the old blood
Rising up through the wooden floor again
Just the old love
Asking for more again
============================================================
Minor Joan Crawford Vehicle
============================================================
Cheap drapes frame the windows, no one speaks his mind
Buckling asphalt up ahead, smoking wreck behind
Stock footage of a ballroom nearly flooded with champagne
We're lost in the desert and it's never going to rain

Every time in this house someone opens up his mouth
All his hopes and dreams begin their dizzy journey south
When the pipes began to freeze we turned on all the taps
Tearing a good thing to pieces, bickering over the scraps

Fried clams from the diner, diesel on the wind
Gorge ourselves on caviar when the boat comes in
Wait for someone neutral to reckon up the score
Grease on the walls of the kitchen, dried blood on the living room floor

You there in your nightgown, head all full of dreams
All the things we'd sewn together splitting at the seams
Try to cauterize the wound, just get nowhere fast
Holding each other for dear life, shielding ourselves from the blast
============================================================
Mobile
============================================================
Jonah went down to the docks to flee from the wrath of the Lord
but the mark on his forehead was visible to everybody on board
They threw him down to the water but he did not drown
I’m on a balcony in Mobile, Alabama, waiting for the wind to throw me down

Now the Lord told the great fish, be free of your burden
And Jonah emerged from his darkness like a dancer crashing through the curtain
And the plant grew but it withered and it shriveled up and turned brown
I’m on a balcony in Mobile, Alabama, waiting for the wind to throw me down

Lord, if you won’t keep me safe and warm
Then send down the storm
Send down the storm

Jonah was sure he heard voices, maybe just one voice but real clear
And where he went, the voice followed, sometimes hardly loud enough to hear
“Shall I not spare the wise with the wicked? Hold back my wrath from this town?”
I am on a balcony in Mobile, Alabama, waiting for the wind to throw me down

May I address the foreman of the jury?
Why do you hold back your fury?
Don’t hold back your fury
============================================================
Mole
============================================================
I came to see you up there in intensive care
They had handcuffed you to your bed
There were tubes going into you and out from you
Bright white gauze bandages at your head

I am a mole
Sticking his head above the surface of the earth
I am a mole
Sticking his head above the surface of the earth

And they said "Lights out"
And it was lights out
And they gave you your medication
I know what you want and you know what I want
Information
Information

I am a mole
Sticking his head above the surface of the earth
I am a mole
Sticking his head above the surface of the earth

Out in the desert we'll have no worries
Out in the desert just you and me
I came to see you up there in intensive care
Out in the desert we'll live carefree

I am a mole
Sticking his head above the surface of the earth
I am a mole
Sticking his head above the surface of the earth

Moon Over Goldsboro
============================================================
I went down to the gas station
For no particular reason
Heard the screams from the high school
It's football season

Empty lot the station faces
Will probably be there forever
I climbed over the four foot fence
I was trying to sever the tether

Moon in the sky
Cold as a stone
Spend each night in your arms
Always wake up alone

I lay down in the weeds
It was a real cold night
I was happy 'til the overnight attendant
Switched on the floodlight

Walking home I was talking to you under my breath
Saying things I would never say directly
I heard a siren on the highway up ahead
Kinda wished they'd come and get me

Frost on the sidewalk
White as a bone
Tried to get close to you again
Always wake up alone

And as I was crossing our doorstep
I hesitated just a moment there
Remembered the day we moved in to our small house
'Til the vision got too vivid to bear

You were almost asleep
Halfway undressed
I lay right down next to you
held your head against my chest

And a guy with any kind of courage
would maybe stop to think the matter through
Maybe hold you still and raise the question
Instead of blindly holding onto you

But we crank up the heat
And you giggle and moan
Spend all night in the company of ghosts
Always wake up alone
============================================================
Moon and Sand
============================================================
Deep is the midnight sea
Warm is the fragrant night
Sweet are your lips to me
Soft as the moon and sand

Oh, when shall we meet again
When the night has left us
Will the spell remain

Though waves invade the shore
And though we may kiss no more
Night is at our command
Moon and sand

Though waves invade the shore
And though we may kiss no more
Night is at our command
Moon and sand
============================================================
Mosquito Repellent
============================================================
All day all day
Sweeping out the shards
Do what I have to do
Try to start anew
But I thought of you twice
Couldn't help myself
I don't know what I need
Clutching and fingering the rosary beads

But I try, try, try, but I know
I can't let go
Try, try, try, but I know
I can't let go

TV upstairs
Leave it on all night
Do what I have to do
Add, subtract, and divide by two
But my eyes light up
At Cops and Robbers time
I hope the bad guys win
I hope the good guys get their skulls bashed in

And I try, try, try, but I know
I can't let go
I can't let go

Moth and Worm
============================================================
Tom's got a brand new car
Jamie married a Korean girl
Jack made a fortune in commodity options
I've got a window on the world

Freeways get better every year
The matrix is impossible to break
Once I get my life together
I'm going up to Crater Lake

April again
April again

Every three years or so
We get a little snow around here
We get a little snow every three years or so
Not this year

People I went to school with
Are dining on pheasant under glass
God has got me in the palm of his hand
I've got a place beneath the underpass

April again
April again
April again
April again

Mountain Goats Busking Song

Come on down and see the Mountain Goats show
Greatest show in town, don't you know
Won't you come on down, come on down, and see the Mountain Goats show

Mountain Goats, Mountain Goats, Mountain Goats

Mountain Goats Shirt Song
============================================================
Please buy the shirts
The shirts are so nice
You'll look stylish
In your Mountain Goats shirt
Ooh ooh ooh

People see you walking down the street, they say
Who's that handsome person
In the Mountain Goats shirt

You will seek out your family who you haven't seen in ten years and you're kinda worried how the whole thing's gonna go
And you show up at the door and they say God
It's good to see you
In your Mountain Goats shirt

After the College of Cardinals was done voting
And it was announced that Cardinal Ratzinger, who leans rather far right, was gonna be the new Holy Father for better or worse
He could've made a better first impression on the world media
In his Mountain Goats shirt

So if you're lonely
Or shirtless
Stop by the merchandising table and check out Mr. Vanderslice
He's attractive and I hear he's available
And he's got a whole table full of Mountain Goats shirts
============================================================
Mourn Not the Dead
============================================================
Mourn not the dead that in the cool earth lie
Dust unto dust
The calm, sweet earth that mothers all who die
As all men must
As all men must

Mourn not your captive comrades who must dwell
Too strong to strive
Within each steel-bound coffin of a cell
Buried alive
Buried alive

But rather mourn the apathetic throng
The cowed and the meek
Who see the world's great anguish and its wrong
And dare not speak
And see the world's great anguish and its wrong
And dare not speak

Murder at the 18th St. Garage
============================================================
I'm in the repair bay casting spells
Mystic in the glow of the spotlight
Ringing out the funeral bells
Tending the fires, gathering power
May I present the man of the hour

Placing his faith in the strength of the safety visor
Placing his faith in the strength of the safety visor
Leaving only slightly diminished
Older but wiser

I'm down on the concrete with a bucket and rag
When you've got a big job to do
You notice how the moments drag
Live in the present, savor the grind
Relish the time before you have to leave it behind

Placing your faith in the strength of the safety visor
Placing your faith in the strength of the safety visor
Leaving only slightly diminished
Older but wiser

Smarter but scared, now
Wearing an exile's mark
One that's going to glow in the dark

I'm out on the sidewalk, scrubbed clean
Take all your worry and care
Feed it to the big machine
Once you commit to the turn, you're going to have to follow through
Cover your eyes when the splash comes
It's the only thing you can do

Placing your faith in the strength of the safety visor
Placing your faith in the strength of the safety visor
Leaving only slightly diminished
Older but wiser

Mutiny in Heaven
============================================================
Well I jumped and fled this fucking heap on doctored wings
My flaming pinions
Damn things nearly hardly snapped
Canker upon canker upon one million tiny punctures
That look like long thin red ribbons draped across the arms of a little mortal girl
Like a ground plan of hell

If this is heaven I'm bailin out
I can't tolerate this old tin-tub
So fulla trash and rats
Felt one crawl across my soul
For a second I thought I was back down there with you in the fucking ghetto
Punishment? Reward! Punishment? Reward!
Hey there's a mutiny in heaven

My Favorite Things

Champagne bubbled up through the neck of the bottle
And sweet sounds came out through the radio
It was John Coltrane
God damn it, I love John Coltrane

You danced across the living room floor
And you kissed me once and then you kissed me some more
You had your arms around my neck and it felt real fine
And then your ankle knocked up against mine
And resonating in my bones
The precise, crisp drumming of Mr. Elvin Jones
God damn it, I love John Coltrane

My Little Panda

Who is my friend

Who was a pacifier
Before he grew up some
Who's always by my side
When the day is done

My little panda
My little panda

Bring him downstairs to greet the day
He watches over my room when I'm away

Who helps me learn
To get things done on my own
Who knows how soon
I will be all grown

My Mask
============================================================
You spent Champagne Saturday on your knees
With your eyes on the clock and your head through wall
The sun came through the window sickly
And you didn't look up, you didn't flinch
Buy you a chainsaw for your birthday
All the wine you could ever drink
Lay you in a bed of cold steel
Cover your face with my fine white mask
You spent Champagne Saturday on your knees
But you'll never have to beg
Oh John Barleycorn, oh John Barleycorn
Old and young, thy praises sung
John Barleycorn

Naming Day
============================================================
I am hiding in the house
Someone’s coming through the gate
When the doorbell sounds like an air-raid siren
I am lying in wait

People used to come around
They fish-eyed and they rubber-necked
Anyone who’d come to visit now
Is automatically a suspect

I creep up to the window
Me and my buzzing brain
And we watch two Jehovah's Witnesses
Retreating down the lane

I’m not coming out yet
It’s too cold
Leave me alone 'til I learn
How to spin straw into gold

I put on night-vision goggles
Work my way along the wall into the kitchen
As soon as the first snow fell this year
My fingers started itching

And I locked up the doors
And I sealed up all the windows
And friends came by sometimes for a while
I never let ’em in though

And then they stopped, and then they stopped at last
And now it’s just us three
These walls and the Church of Jesus Christ
Of the Latter Day Saints and me

And I’m not coming out yet
It’s too cold
Leave me alone 'til I learn
How to spin straw into gold

The cabbages that I will grow
One by one and row on row
Will fatten in the spring sun
And breathe in the evening air

And you will hear them breathing
If you walk by at night
You may not hear them after all
But that's all right

I've set the table for two
I've cleaned the windows for you
I've got cinnamon from Jakarta
For making French toast
The doctor says that I've got
Thirty days left at most

The cabbages that I will grow
The love songs on the radio
Will deepen in the springtime
They'll be brighter than the stars
============================================================
Need More Bandages
============================================================
Stockpiles of ammunition in wooden crates
Stenciled with exotic ports of call
White rags stuffing up glass jugs
Clean-burning overproof alcohol
I did not seek out the mission,
But the mission found me
Twenty-one years old
I mean to learn what it's like to be free

We're going to need more bandages
We're going to need more bandages
Cheap overseas tobacco
Hidden treasures within
You can even smoke it if you're desperate
We do get desperate now and again
I am not the first to follow the plan,
Just a cog in the machine
I'm just here to run interference
Dancing like a fly on the screen

We're going to need more bandages
We're going to need more bandages

More bandages - more shovels!
When the shovels break,
We've still got our fingernails!

Why wait until tomorrow?
Victory awaits with the dawn!
If we all get blown to pieces,
We can leave a nasty mark when we're gone
I did not hunt down the moment,
It found me in a dream
Struck down as a warning to the others
Nothing without my brothers

We're going to need more bandages
We're going to need more bandages

Never Quite Free
============================================================
​It's so good to learn
that right outside your window
There's only friendly fields
and open roads
And you'll sleep better when you think
you've stepped back from the brink
And found some peace inside yourself;
lay down your heavy load

It gets alright
to dream at night
Believe in solid skies
and slate blue earth below
But when you see him, you'll know

It's okay to find
the faith to saunter forward
There's no fear of shadows
spreading where you stand
And you'll breathe easier just knowing
that the worst is all behind you
And the waves that tossed the raft
all night have set you on dry land

It gets okay
to praise the day
Believe in sheltering skies
and stable earth beneath
But hear his breath come
through his teeth

Walk by faith
Tell no one what you've seen

It's so good to learn
that from right here
the view goes on forever
And you'll never want for comfort,
and you'll never be alone
See the sunset turning red,
let all be quiet in your head
And look about,
all the stars are coming out

They shine like steel swords
Wish me well where I go
But when you see me, you'll know
============================================================
New Britain
============================================================
You've had it up to here with my west country talk
You can hardly understand a word I say
The shortest tree around here is a hundred feet tall
It's gonna rain today

I try and tell you secrets 'til my face turns blue
I am not getting through to you
All the way across the ocean
They're gathering their strength again
Lining up along the country's length again
This morning I know who you are
This morning I know who you are

On the river, the sun is bright gold
And the things you try to say to me make my blood run cold
But I hold you anyway
And we stare into the sun all day
And you're about to leave again
I've learned to read your movements
And I'm learning how to read your mind
The sun climbs the sky for us above the Mississippi
And I can feel you in my arms, but you're hardly even with me
This morning I know who you are
This morning I know who you are

New Chevrolet in Flames
============================================================
We were drinking Colorado Bulldogs
When inspiration struck
And we knew it was high time
For us to change our own luck
We cracked a couple Coca-Colas open
Mixed them up with vodka and some coffee liqueur
Poured in some cold milk, raised our glasses high to old friends
My love for you is ninety-eight percent pure

But the two percent that remains
Has fried the circuits in my brain

I got out my smoking jacket
You put on some fishnets and your smart black beret
We cut quite a figure in the mirror
And then we were on our way
Oh would that you would kiss me
With the kisses of your mouth
'Cause your mouth is sweeter than wine, and has
A more complicated history than the American South

As the evening
Took us in
You could have popped the tension
With a safety pin

We went down to Pete Brown's Chevrolet
'Cause Pete Brown can satisfy all your new car needs
We were nicely oiled by then
Our internal transponders picking up satellite feeds
From well-worn ancient places
Our eager young sales rep handed us the keys
We drove about three quarters of a mile
All that's left for us now are moments like these

We parked behind the high school
Away from the light
And the flames climbed high into the night
============================================================
New London
============================================================
And here in New London, it's raining again
And here in New London, it's raining again and again and again and again

If you ever get money, print books
If you ever get money, print books
If nobody reads them that's okay
If nobody hears what you have to say, that's okay

If you sell a few books, buy land
If you sell a few books, buy land
If no one come to visit you that's all right
If no one comes to visit you and you get lonely at night
That's all right

When you've built up your small house, settle in
When you've built up your stronghold, settle in
Take down the books that you once put away
Wait for the memories to bloom in your cold room
============================================================
New Monster Avenue
============================================================
Shadows on the broad lawn canopy of trees
Sometime after midnight the ground is gonna freeze
Birds in the frosty air
What are they doing there?

Greenhouse full of butcher's-brooms
Breezes at my back
Sometime before the sun comes up
The earth is gonna crack

I look down at my hands
Like they were mirrors

Fresh coffee at sunrise
Warm my lips against the cup
Been waiting such a long time now
My number's finally coming up

All the neighbors come on out to their front porches
Waving torches
============================================================
New Mountain Goats Tape Song
============================================================
Now men of old have said that the day was coming
And the mages of Asgard had foretold that the day was coming
And the ancient texts have all agreed someday there would be a new Mountain Goats tape

I here paraphrase the Mighty Thor issue 272 I’m pretty sure
But not entirely sure as all my old comic books got left at the old house when we moved
Anyway

There’s gonna be a new Mountain Goats tape you might wanna watch this space on Friday
There’s gonna be a new Mountain Goats tape you might wanna watch this space on Friday
You might wanna watch this space on Friday

New Star Song
============================================================
I hung pictures of you from every lamp post in town
As the humidity climbed into numbers I don't care to repeat
The air was heavy and the sky was alive
And the Pacific Starlight train wasn't due in 'til 11:45

I thought about how cold you must be
I thought about things I thought that I'd soon be forgetting
I thought of you up in Canada as the lightning storms lit up
All downtown Redding

There were teenagers in mini-trucks coming around every corner
You could taste the adrenaline coming out through their skin
I came to the well-lit doorway of a sheet music store
I saw my face in the glass, sat down in the doorway and I settled in

I thought about how cold you must be
I thought about things I thought that I'd soon be forgetting
I thought of you up in Canada as the lightning storms lit up
All downtown Redding

New World Emerging Blues
============================================================
Someday, someday Mount Fuji's gonna blow
Someday, someday Mount Fuji's gonna blow
And spray hot ashes on the villagers below

Someday, someday the ocean's gonna rise
Someday, someday the ocean's gonna rise
And I will emerge from hiding and shrug off my disguise

Someday, someday the earth will be black as tar
Someday the earth will be as black as tar
And we are gonna see each other the way we truly are
============================================================
New Zion
============================================================
There were signs up in the sky
When we gathered by the garden wall
Everybody on his best behavior
Listening for the altar call

High priest of Salem in his robes
Ranting out the coming of the day
Ravens at the gates
Frightening all the visitors away

I lay down by the water
Dreamed a dream of where I come from
Old things made new
Waiting for you

There were wooden wind-chimes rustling
In the trees above the anthills on the dunes
On the high winds we could hear them
Old familiar tunes

The little bit of faith we had once
Like the memory of a movie
They got burned up in the great fire
Reassembling itself slowly but surely

I lay down by the water
Dreamed a dream of where I come from
Old things made new
Waiting for you
============================================================
Night Light
============================================================
Pull my mask so tight
Til it pinches my skin
Nerves strung so high
I am a mandolin
Jenny calls from Montana
She's only passing through
Probably never see her again in this life I guess
Not sure what I'm gonna do

Plug a night light in
Leave the porch light on
Because the small dark corners have designs on me
Live like an outlaw
Clutching gold coins in his claw

Room full of ambitious young policemen
Everybody trying to make his mark
I was a red dot blinking on a screen up overhead
And then the room went dark
Dream of maybe waking up someday
And wanting you less than I do
This is a dream though
It's never gonna come true

Plug a night light in
Leave the porch light on
Because the small dark corners are establishing a colony
Live like an outlaw
Clutching gold coins in his claw

Can't ever set aside the sweetness
Of the days before the crews put up the border
Fields full of wet rain
Cling tight to their memory forever
Think about Montana when I close my eyes
Possibly Jenny's headed east
Count a couple of stray hopes out loud
May their numbers one day be increased

Plug a night light in
Leave the porch light on
Because the small dark corners breathe like heavy animals
Live like an outlaw
Clutching gold coins in his claw
============================================================
Night of the Mules
============================================================
Streetlights gave off a yellow glow
On the holly and the mistletoe
You could feel the rain coming down
And quiet starlight hardened the ground
'Til the street shone like a diamond
Look sister, here comes a new genuine disaster
Clip-clop up the street
See the rain, feel the sleet
Yeah

The cold air, unpredictable weather
Ten or twenty of us huddled together
Hearing the braying growing louder
Snowflakes falling, fine white powder
Here come the new kings
The hooves clack and the metal sings
Clip-clop up the street
See the rain, feel the sleet
Yeah
============================================================
Nikki Oh Nikki
============================================================
You know that guy
Who swept your girlfriend off her feet and out of your arms
In the summer between the sixth and the seventh grade
You know how his name sits in your brain like a tumor
And how his bright eyes shine in your memory
Even now

Let it bug you if you really want to but
Friend, let me assure you he's gonna die
You can take it to the bank that he's gonna die some day
He's gonna die
Maybe a few years before you do
Maybe a few years later
What does it matter in the long run

You know that girl who you told your secrets to back in high school
The one who faithfully broadcast all of them
Throughout the generous pool of your mutual acquaintances
And made it sound like you were psycho
And in need of professional help
Yes yes, yes you do remember

Well you can carry that grudge or you can let it go
But as sure as I'm singing this song you know
She's gonna die
She's gonna die, yeah she will
Five'll get you ten, she'll meet the same undignified end
That I will, and you will
And everyone we know

It may happen twenty years down the line
Or it may happen an hour from now
What does it matter
What does it matter in the long run

Everyone who's done you wrong
Everyone who's done you favors
Everyone you like, everyone you can't stand the sight of
What does it matter
What does it matter in the long run

Nine Black Poppies
============================================================
When I got home I meant to give you some sweet chrysanthemum
The wind chimes were ringing all wrong
And you were standing in the doorway singing along
And I tried to remember how nice it had been
A long long time ago
But I couldn't remember
I honestly could not remember

And a package came for you today from the Hunan province
The postmark burning jet black in the summer sun
Someone was changing, someone was changing from the inside out
And I turned around to face you

Sweet peas in the garden, all in full bloom
And I thought I heard the traces of an old song murmuring in the room
Like a half-remembered conversation, but I let it fall away
And then I could not remember
I honestly could not remember

And a package came for you today, from the Hunan province
The postmark burning jet black in the summer sun
Someone was changing, someone was changing from the inside out
And I turned around to face you
============================================================
No, I Can't
============================================================
You bought me some chocolates
And you bought me a rose
And you brought me a paper bag
And you brought me a lamp

Thank you for the chocolates
Thank you for the rose
Thank you for the paper bag
Thank you for the lamp

Now I have everything I need
Now I have everything I need
Now I have everything I need
Now I have everything I need

You brought me a sofa
And you brought me some books
And you brought me a filing cabinet
And you brought me a Panasonic DX-4500

thank you for the sofa
thank you for the books
thanks for the filing cabinet
I don't know what I
I don't know what I
Ever did without it

Now I have everything I need
Now I have everything I need
Now I have everything I need
Now I have everything I need

You came by, and you came in
And you let the wind in
It must be cold outside
We stared out through the sliding glass door
But I'd forgotten what we were looking for

Thank you for coming by
It's nice to see you once in a while
Thanks for the coat I forgot to mention
I've been freezing in here
I've been freezing in here

Now I have everything I need
Now I have everything I need
Now I have everything I need
Now I have everything I need, yeah
============================================================
No Children
============================================================
I hope that our few remaining friends
Give up on trying to save us
I hope we come up with a failsafe plot
To piss off the dumb few that forgave us
I hope the fences we mended
Fall down beneath their own weight
And I hope we hang on past the last exit
I hope it's already too late
And I hope the junkyard a few blocks from here
Someday burns down
And I hope the rising black smoke carries me far away
And I never come back to this town
Again in my life
I hope I lie
And tell everyone you were a good wife
And I hope you die
I hope we both die

I hope I cut myself shaving tomorrow
I hope it bleeds all day long
Our friends say it's darkest before the sun rises
We're pretty sure they're all wrong
I hope it stays dark forever
I hope the worst isn't over
And I hope you blink before I do
Yeah I hope I never get sober
And I hope when you think of me years down the line
You can't find one good thing to say
And I'd hope that if I found the strength to walk out
You'd stay the hell out of my way
I am drowning
There is no sign of land
You are coming down with me
Hand in unlovable hand
And I hope you die
I hope we both die

No Mas

A mining town.
A yearning town.
Crumpled in the rubble.
Like so many other shattered souls around.
With no one.
Your heart is a rock.
I'll take a lichen to you at sundown.

No More Tears
============================================================
Insane in a studio in Los Angeles
Rudderless and hungry and high
Ideas of no earthly consequence
Float across my consciousness
And then go dark
As bullseyes

Go down the devil's way
Go down a twenty devil way

Twenty years on they'll be asking what I remember
Go where the dry dust crawlers tread
The fire in the vocal booth
The doctor who filed down my teeth
Dreams from the ether overhead

Go down the devil's way
Go down a twenty devil way

Lit candles pressed into the walls down there
Three cans of Aqua Net in my greying hair

Arsenic drifting down through the hourglass
Track-lit hallways that go on for days
Floating like a Portuguese man o' war
Pretty hardcore
Fire offerings, burnt offerings
Thanks and praise

Go down the devil's way
Go down the devil's way
Go down the devil's way
Go down a twenty devil way
============================================================
No Surprises
============================================================
Heart that's full up like a landfill
A job that slowly kills you
Bruises that won't heal
I'll take a quiet life, a handshake
Some carbon monoxide
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises

You look so tired and unhappy
Bring down the government
They don't, they don't speak for us
Such a pretty house and such a pretty garden
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
============================================================
Noche del Guajolote
============================================================
The glowing world, the bench backed up against the house
The chicken coops, the darkness surrounding everything
It was late and the night was moving slowly
We laid down on the ground because the world was lonely

If you keep quiet it will stay like this forever
If you'll just keep quiet it will stay like this forever
I feel certain of it now
And all the birds were sleeping in their perches
A little wind, swaying birches
And the North American wild turkey that your father brought home
Woke up and came towards us

And the moonlight and the turkey waking up
And the night air and the moonlight on your skin
And the moonlight and the turkey waking up
And the quiet yard and the turkey and the moon
Unimaginable, unimaginable, unimaginable
Unimaginable

Noctifer Birmingham
============================================================
I had to stop and catch my breath
When the telephone rang out as loud as death
It was three in the morning
There was a low drone of katydids behind your voice
And then I came down from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania
And I saw you by the highway

You asked me if the north was alright
And I said it got kind of cold at night
I could feel your bones shivering way down there in Birmingham
And then I came down from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania
And I saw you by the highway

You reminded me of all the things you'd given up forever
And you asked about the children
And you asked about the weather
And then I came down from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania
And I saw you by the highway

Nothing Song Number 2
============================================================
When the milkman used to leave two fresh quarts of milk
Every other morning just before we woke up
When we saw the guy who used to stock the newspaper machines
Stop his truck and have a cigarette at 5am
Where the birds gathered on the high tension wire
Where we lit the dry leaves on fire
For nothing
Nothing
Nothing

Where the imprint of your head used to be
Pressing in the pillow next to me
When the mailman came in to ask for water
When we turned him away for no good reason
Where things were set up
Where things were knocked over
For nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
============================================================
Nova Scotia
============================================================
Coming in off Nova Scotia
Yellow sun in the blue sky
All those cat-tails in the wind
I got something in my eye

Listen, everything I love I will devour
And bury the bones down in the snow
Put me in a beat up El Camino
Just let me go, just let me go

O Bless the Lord

Oceanographer's Choice
============================================================
Well
Guy in a skeleton costume
Comes up to the guy in the Superman suit
Runs through him with a broadsword
I flip the television off
Bring all the bright lights up
Turn the radio up loud
I don't know why I'm so persuaded
That if I think things through
Long enough and hard enough
I'll somehow get to you
But then you came in and we locked eyes
You kicked the ashtray over as we came toward each other
Stubbed my cigarette out against the west wall
Quickly lit another
Look at that
Would you look at that?
We're throwing off sparks
What will I do when I don't have you
To hold onto in the dark?

Yes
Everybody's going to need a witness
Everybody's going to need a little backup
In case the scene gets nasty
You throw the attic window open
And I throw myself all around you
And night comes to Tallahassee
I don't know why it's gotten harder
To keep myself away
Thought I'd finally beat the feeling back
It all came back today
And then we fell down and we locked arms
We knocked the dresser over as we rolled across the floor
I don't mean it when I tell you
That I don't love you any more
Look at that
Would you look at that?
The way the ceiling starts to swerve
What will I do when I don't have you
When I finally get what I deserve?

Old College Try
============================================================
From the housetops to the gutters
From the ocean to the shore
The warning signs have all been bright and garish
Far too great in number to ignore

From the cities to the swamplands
From the highways to the hills
Our love has never had a leg to stand on
From the aspirins to the cross-tops to the Elavils
But I will walk down to the end with you
If you will come all the way down with me

From the entrance to the exit
Is longer than it looks from where we stand
I want to say I'm sorry for stuff I haven't done yet
Things will shortly get completely out of hand
I can feel it in the rotten air tonight
In the tips of my fingers
In the skin on my face
In the weak last gasp of the evening's dying light
In the way those eyes I've always loved illuminate this place
Like a trashcan fire in a prison cell
Like the searchlights in the parking lots of hell
I will walk down to the end with you
If you will come all the way down with me
============================================================
Omega Blaster

You've come back from Yosemite
You brought an aromatic cedar bookmark for me
And a brand new stuffed bear
It's summertime, you've cut your hair
And I am leaving you
And I am sorry

You come in through the back door
Why're you coming in like that, smiling for
I have got something I need to tell you
I can feel your smile burning through
And I am leaving you
And I am sorry
============================================================
One Fine Day
============================================================
One fine day you'll look at me
And you will know our love was meant to be
Yeah, one fine day you're gonna want me for your own

Those arms I've yearned for will open wide
And you'll be proud to have me right by your side
Yeah, one fine day you're gonna want me for your own

And though I know you're the kind of girl
Who only wants to run around
I'll keep waiting and someday, darling
You'll come to me when you want to settle down

Yeah, one fine day we'll meet once more
And you're gonna want the love you threw away before
Yeah, one fine day you're gonna want me for your own
Yeah

One Frozen River
============================================================
When my old friend came crawling up the hill
Broken and bloody
Carrying her hair in clumps in her hands
I let her right on in
Let her right in

When she stood near the kitchen window
Staring out at the countryside
And then she looked my way
I let her right on in
Let her right in

And when she was stronger than she'd been before
I opened the front door
And I opened the back door
And the sunlight poured in, yeah
============================================================
One Morning in Northern Italy
============================================================
I was mending my garden, sweeping up the frozen soil
When I heard a loud cracking sound come through the rocks that blocked the mountain path
And I saw a huge hole appear in the mountain's flowering side
And I saw him and his crew come through, two elephants wide
And Hannibal came down
And Hannibal came down

One Winter at Point Alpha Privative
============================================================
What the hell kind of deal is it here anyway?
How much does it cost and how long can you stay?
Should we dance? should we sing? should we curse? should we pray?
Do I have to hang on every single word that you say?
Every hour, every minute, every second of the day
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

What the hell's going on at the edges of your face?
Is there something eating you? Will it leave a single trace?
Will it take your pretty features and lay them all to waste?
Could we sit down over there? could we sit down any place?
Can you feel the spirit moving? can you feel god's grace?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

Ever since I've married you I've wondered what it means.
That every single shirt I owned has burst out at the seams
Every single piece of clothing, every last pair of jeans,
All the reds, all the whites, all the yellows, all the greens.
I'm sure that there's a reason all of this is happening.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

Onions
============================================================
The last white slabs of snow
Melted off seven weeks ago
And the geese are headed north again
Through the tightening sky
And I can feel my heart in my throat again
New onions growing in the ground

The cows come gingerly out of the barn
And when they see that the ground is warm
They pick up a little speed
It makes me feel so good
And then I feel it rushing down my throat—fresh blood
I head out onto the earth
Its cold heart is melting
I don't know if I can stand it
Springtime's coming, that means you'll be coming back around
New onions growing underground
Underground

Only Existing Footage
============================================================
Fix the overheads, the glare's become too much at last
Have somebody try to boost morale amongst the cast
Thermoses of coffee in the frozen dawn
Blow a fuse and spend an hour just trying to get the power back on

Space heater starves it out again, something's gotta give
Oblivion's been calling since it found out where I live

Try to grab another take before the night descends
Blocking's pretty good, but there's a gate hair on the lens
And the script girl's wandered off so we improvise the plot
Lousy continuity, the coats won't match from shot to shot

Light meter's broken down again, soundtrack doesn't sync
Annihilation's pouring since it found out where I drink

Red-eye back to Belgrade with the footage we can save
End up with one can because the baggage claim's an unmarked grave

Hold off the backers, put a notice in the press
Oblivion's been knocking since I gave it my address
============================================================
Only One Way
============================================================
You're going to get a wrinkle on your forehead
You're gonna get a click in your knee
You're gonna tell the doctor that you can't sleep

And you're up every night until three

You're gonna make a bargain with the bad guys
You're gonna make some choices you regret
There's no place to hide from the prophecy
Since nobody told you it falls to me

There's only one way out
There's only one way out
There's only one way through
No matter what you do

You're gonna have to watch for the signs
You're gonna have to learn how to read
Nobody's gonna hand you a flashlight
You're gonna have to steal what you need

You're gonna have some trouble at the border
They're never gonna let you forget
I'm just passing on the information
Beaming down to me from a distant station

There's only one way out
There's only one way out
I've been told there's only one way through
No matter what you do
But if all that's true
What about you?
What about you?

Only Takes a Few

Almost missed this one, he said
I stared at the honky-tonk piano
Sure beats living in town
The beach is a half a mile away
Not much of the cat, I said
He stared down underneath the couch
It doesn't matter much to me
Not gonna beat it, anyway

It only takes a few cents more to go first class
First class only takes a few
It only takes a few cents more to go first class
First class only takes a few

It's called quintessence, I said
She stared at an Oreo cookie in black and white
After water, earth, air and fire
The fifth and highest plane
Lobster okay? she said
I stared at her refrigerator door
There'll be enough for the guy in the attic
What's his name?

It only takes a few cents more to go first class
First class only takes a few
It only takes a few cents more to go first class
First class only takes a few

Shared a floor with Nashville
The burger queen bought herself a pearl
A bloke named Boob McNutt bounced in
With art and a very pretty Kelly Girl
Downstairs, two Spanish lovers were singing along
With some domestic Don Juan
I had to pinch myself, what a hell of a house I'd stumbled on

June, July, August, she said
They stared at the summer about to fade away
Damn good three months of my life
I remember now what living is
The cat's now a cat, I say
You stare at the honky-tonk piano man
Watch your step
I just met Oliver, the lobster's his

It only takes a few good friends to be first class
First class only takes a few
It only takes a few good friends to be first class
First class only takes a few

First class only takes a few
It only takes a few
It only takes a few
It only takes a few

I know what my weaknesses are
Probably better than you do
Revolutionary Chinese propaganda
The color of blue
I thought I knew what my weaknesses were anyway
Then the orange tree blossomed last Saturday
There was nothing in it but pain for me

I know what can hurt me real bad
And what can't hurt me anymore
I know how to rise up with the sun
And I am learning what sleep's good for
I thought I'd figured out the world and its circular way
And then I saw the sun fall down out of the sky the other day
There was nothing in it but pain for me

Squirrels climbing trees in bloom
Soft yellow light spilling into the room
My favorite records
My favorite books
The people I love
The people I almost love
Light beckoning, wind whistling
Hey hey
Hey hey
Day breaking, river rolling
Hey hey
La la la la

Orange

Three of us
Headed to demon
You peel oranges
Sharing slices with your father
You have to be extra careful
Not to drip juice
On the fine Corinthian leather

Rome wasn't built in a day
Rome wasn't built in a day
Rome wasn't built in a day
Rome wasn't built in a day

Three of us
Headed to demon
You peel oranges
Sharing slices with your father

Orange Ball of Hate
============================================================
When I hear the screeching weather vane
In the wild wind and the pissing rain
I know that one of us, I'm not saying who,
Has got rocks in her head
The rain comes through the open window
But you don't think so
I sure do love you
I sure do love you

When I notice that the radio is broken
I see you standing there in the doorway soaking
The water drizzles off of you down to the floor
And I say that I don't want to live in New England anymore
Some flower petals stick to your skin
I grab hold of your hip, and I pull you in

When the building establishes control
When the thunder from the north begins to roll down our way
I know I’ve been right all along
And you start singing that stupid children's song
You think I don't know it
But I just don't feel like singing it
Sure do love you
I sure do love you
============================================================
Orange Ball of Love
============================================================
When I catch sight of your face
And the late light falling on it
I feel scared and I scope the area out for a good place to hide
When I feel the way your fingers
Wiggle in my palm
I feel warm and I feel good inside

And I know that you're wearing a wire
But as the sun becomes a blazing orange ball of fire
I lose interest in this and other such inconsequential questions

When you kick off your shoes
And I see the wet grass give way underneath your feet
And the sunset rears up once more to its burial ground
Well, you look so sweet

And I know you'll be turning me in
But I also know your real name's not Amy Lynn
And as the orange globe rears up to swallow us, too
I see you look at me and figure out what I know about you
Well, I’m not telling
I'm not telling you anything
============================================================
Orange Ball of Pain
============================================================
When I saw it on the bakery carousel
I knew I had to have it for my own
I eased it out
And I brought it home
Why don't you try some
I already had some myself

Is that the most delicious thing
You ever tasted in your life
Is that the most delicious thing
You ever tasted in your life

And then the cold sorrow gripped me by the throat
And then I felt the colder sadness taking hold
I knew I had to have it for my own
Why don't you try some
Why don't you try some

Is that the most delicious thing
You ever tasted in your life
Is that the most delicious thing
You ever tasted in your life

And I saw the snow against the window
And I saw the snow hit the window
And I saw the snow brush against the window
And then I saw the snow again
============================================================
Orange Ball of Peace
============================================================
They wanted me to be a lawyer
They wanted me to work in a machine shop
They wanted me to be a designer
But I came out on top
I'm a fireman
I'm a fireman

Stand and watch the smoke
See the flames rise to the sky
I stand and watch the flames climb higher
I feel the smoke get in my eyes
I'm a fireman
I'm a fireman

Original Air-Blue Gown
============================================================
Rain all burned away
The horseflies are an iridescent green
Plums boiled down to pulp
Drying on a screen

Bright red air inside the house here
I can barely draw breath
Dark blue shapes popped behind my eyelids
I am not afraid of death

And on the television
Black and white footage of the young Cassius Clay
My God, my God, my God
He was something

Fists flashing as he comes toward the screen
Sailing headlong into nothing
And disappearing, reappearing
Out there in the clearing
Floating down the slight breeze
That plays along the edges of the leaves
It's you
It's you
It's you
============================================================
Oslo 1888
============================================================
The snow built up around the smokehouse
And the sun shone on the snow
And the sun's rays were blistering against my eyes
The long night was well on its way
So I made good use of what was left of the daylight
Walking out toward the main street
And coming back home again
Sleeping, I sang a short song about you
And I knew every word of that song was true
Well, almost every word

Ice froze the green stems of the daffodils
Ice formed carrots on my window sill
I was blistering, blazing away
And it had always been my tendency to let things slide
But I went to the window with my eyes open wide
And you were taking on perspective
Coming toward the door
You want some more
I've got some more for you
I've got just what you're looking for

If you really want to conjure up a ghost
Cultivate a space
for the things that hurt you most

Rake the sands until they surface
Blind their tiny eyes

Stake out your position,
let your armor fall
Stay put till they find you,
it won't take long at all

Rake the sands until they surface
Up they come, gone translucent

They're coming up no matter what
Fools rush in and the doors slam shut

Ghosts of my childhood
stay with me,if you will
Find a place where there's water,
hold you under til you're still

Rake the sands until they surface
Don't let anybody call them ugly

Ox Baker Triumphant
============================================================
I will rise from the swamp where they dumped my private plane
I'll be clutching the life preserver in my teeth
And I will find the highway
And I will flag down a truck
Worry lines on my forehead, blank stare underneath

And when I come back to town
I'm gonna cast my burden down
A little worse for wear
Practically walking on air

I will thank my ride and crawl my way back inside
To the guts of the building where my enemies
Hide in the dark like roaches
And I will signal the camera crew
And everyone will do what he's been trained how to do
Sweat dripping from my face as my moment approaches

Click your heels, count to three
I bet you never expected me
A little worse for wear
Practically walking on air
============================================================
Paid in Cocaine
============================================================
Crusty boots in the corner of the closet by the tackle box
Once-proud shining silver buckles safe behind the normalcy locks
Baubles and bangles
A lost age
Still all aglow with the radiance of the stage
That's who I was
This is who I am
Work to pay down the interest on the mortgage
Used to get paid by the gram

Long Beach
Long Beach, can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Long Beach?
Long Beach
Long Beach, can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Long Beach?

Master tape from the show we did at Fender's back in '85
Dark paisley from Retail Slut
All four of us still fresh and alive
Flashes and phosphenes
It's hard to believe that's me
Strapped in, visibly sweating
As happy as I'm ever gonna be
You're by my side
Five years left on your card
You're cashing out, all dressed up
For your date with the emergency ward

Long Beach
Long Beach, can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Long Beach?
Long Beach
Long Beach, can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Long Beach?

Pale Green Things
============================================================
Got up before dawn
Went down to the racetrack
Riding with the windows down
Shortly after your first heart attack
You parked behind the paddock
Cracking asphalt underfoot
Coming up through the cracks
Pale green things
Pale green things

You watched the horses run their workouts
You held your stopwatch in your left hand
And a racing form beneath your arm
Casting your gaze way out to no man's land
Sometimes I'll meet you out there
Lonely and frightened
Flicking my tongue out at the wet leaves
Pale green things
Pale green things

My sister called at 3 A.M.
Just last December
She told me how you'd died at last
At last
And that morning at the racetrack was one thing I remembered
I turned it over in my mind
Like a living Chinese finger trap
Seaweed in Indiana sawgrass
Pale green things
Pale green things

Holt Boulevard
Between Garey and White
Hooked up with some friends at the Travelodge
Set ourselves up for the night

Carpenter ants in the dresser
Flies in the screen
It will be too late by the time we learn
What these cryptic symbols mean

And I dreamt of a house
Haunted by all you tweakers with your hands out
And the headstones climbed up the hills
And the headstones climbed up the hills

Send somebody out for soda
Comb through the carpet for clues
Reflective tape on our sweatpants
Big holes in our shoes
Every couple minutes someone says he can't stand it any more
Laugh lines on our faces
Scale maps of the ocean floor

And I dreamt of a camera
Pointing out from inside the television
And the aperture yawning and blinking
And the headstones climbed up the hills

If anybody comes to see me
Tell 'em they just missed me by a minute
If anybody comes in to our room while we're asleep
I hope they incinerate everybody in it

And I dreamt of a factory
Where they manufactured what I needed
Using shiny new machines
And the headstones climbed up the hills
============================================================
Papagallo
============================================================
You were standing near the water when the wind ripped through
Heard your throat open up like a champagne bottle
I heard the one perfect song pouring out of you
There was a darkening sky reflected on the river
There was no way of determining where we were
Low hills, colors gone crazy
You standing like a ghost with the water behind you
It's hard to grab ahold of some things sometimes
Like you need me to remind you

You were standing near the water
And I was looking at the water
And then you went down in the water
And the river began to boil
There was a minute when I thought I knew what you were about
And then you opened up your eyes and the lord came out
Low hills, colors gone crazy
You rising from the water like a bird
You had a pure song possessing you from shoulder to hip
And I recognized every single word
============================================================
Parisian Enclave
============================================================
Signal drawn upon the bricks of a clinic for the dispossessed
Collect the brine from the rain gutters, let the devil take the rest
Rats returning home to our nest

Beneath the streets of the city with my brethren in the never-ending shadow
Beneath the streets of the city with my brethren in the never-ending shadow, there I go

Secret hymnal with the words in a version of the mother tongue
Walls envelop all of us like a mother who protects her young
Spores at play deep down in our lungs

Beneath the streets of the city with my brethren in the never-ending shadow
Beneath the streets of the city with my brethren in the never-ending shadow, there I go
============================================================
Parting Friends
============================================================
Farewell, my friends, I'm bound for Canaan
I'm traveling through the wilderness
Your company has been delightful
You, who doth leave my mind distressed
I go away, behind to leave you
Perhaps never to meet again
But if we never have the pleasure
I hope we'll meet on Canaan's land

I to the path will gather early
I know my way is rough and steep
Yea beauteous fields lie just before me
Where those redeemed their vigils keep
I go away, behind to leave you
Perhaps never to meet again
But if we never have the pleasure
I hope we'll meet on Canaan's land
============================================================
Passaic, 1975
============================================================
Write something down in illegible script
As we're approaching the landing strip
New Gibson SG, inlaid with pearl
Tonight Passaic, tomorrow the world

In a Holiday Inn by a nameless river
Renew the assault on my lungs and my liver
And while I'm waiting for the company man
Slip on my kimono that I bought in Japan

Tell the crowd, tell the world
I want everyone to get high
Tell the press, tell the cameras
I want everyone to get high

And the tech crew in Memphis has a present for me
A screen that scrolls lyrics
Like the ones they have on TV
The deluxe model
One of only four thousand made
Black out that night in front of ten thousand paid

And in the back lounge in between the stops
Contingency plans in case the new one flops
Sometimes I wake up coughing up blood
Tonight Indianapolis, tomorrow the flood

Tell the person next to you
I want everyone to get high
Tell your boss, tell your mother
I want everyone to get high
Get high
============================================================
Peacocks
============================================================
I hear them squeal
I see them preen
Fans all spread out
Neat and clean

Grab hold of the morning
Head out to the porch
Feel the wind stopping
Feel the sun scorch
I fear for my safety
You can see it in my eyes
In an hour or two
We will rise

Then a sharp breeze kicks up
I hug myself hard
How come there's peacocks in the front yard?

Sun's all prickly
On my neck
When the helicopter passes
We both hit the deck
Hands grasping and groping
Seizing opportunity
Right where it lies
The sky will fall
We will rise
============================================================
Pennsylvania Dutch Treat
============================================================
Brought in the old furnishings from Muscle Shoals
Up here they burn a lot of brown coal
And the cars all run on diesel fuel
The wind comes in from hills to the east
Blowing thirty miles an hour at least
And the clear blue horizon is smooth and cool
And the house is like a relic of days gone by
And it's kinda hard to take, but I try

I've got a deep need to communicate
I want so badly to set things straight
But I can't seem to concentrate
Deep in the heart of the Quaker state

I had the bed sent in from the west coast
Watched the moving men carry in the old ghosts
And the purple-ink sky swelled up like a pregnant woman
Saw the lights go up in town
On the back porch it began to cool down
But in here, in here, in here it was hotter than an oven
And the way my blood began to froth and foam
Made it feel just like home

I've got a deep need to communicate
I want so badly to set things straight
But something tells me it's way too late
Deep in the heart of the Quaker state

Pet Politics
============================================================
Guard my bed
While the rain turns the ditches to mirrors
Buy a vase of carnations from central Ohio
Where the looking machine can't hear us
Deep in the night we dream of positions
There's a line for the phone in the hall
And in the cold places where Spanish is spoken
Most wars end in the fall
You never know when your pet will go
Pet politics

Still wearing last night's mascara
Now that her pet was gone for sure
She was shivering so hard
It looked like there were two of her
I can see through the sleeve on her blouse
The mute plans of her architect lover
A tattoo of a boarded up house
An ink door that belonged to another
When the rain hits you, it hits you slow
Stitch after stitch
Stitch after stitch

Adam was not the first man
Though the Bible tells us so
There was one created before him
Whose name we do not know
He also lived in the garden
But he had no mouth or eyes
One day Adam came to kill him
And he died beneath these skies
I find it so amazing how
I go where I'm led
I go where I'm led
I go where I'm led
I go where I'm led

I suspect we could be losing now
Please guard my bed
Please guard my bed

Pez Dorado
============================================================
Echoes from a nursery rhyme
Hide in plain sight all this time
Here you come splashing in your summer clothes
You and your pale pink toes

Just there where the shadow falls
There we follow one and all
Can't resist the creeping dark
Ready to make our mark

Little red fish beneath the surface of the water
Testing the break point in case we get lucky

Ancient blood is patient blood
We were here before the flood
Waiting for our time to shine
Sparks in a silver mine

Shorebirds deal death all day long
We are weak but they are strong
Lose some friends along the way
Then in you come one day

Little red fish beneath the surface of the water
Scales in the sun, stars in a shot glass
Testing the break point in case we get lucky

Take your time, we've got all day
Days beyond that, come what may
If you get home tell all your friends
The spawning tide never ends

Say what you felt when you found us here
Here where the waters run crystal clear
One summer day in your summer clothes
The day you saw several ghosts

Little red fish beneath the surface of the water
Hungry for years, senses sharpened by the hunger
Testing the break point in case we get lucky
============================================================
Philippians 3:20-21
============================================================
The path to the awful room that no one will sleep in again
Was lit for one man only gone where none can follow him
Try to look down the way he'd gone
Back of a closet whose depths go and on and on

And nice people said he was with God now
Safe in his arms
But the voices of the angels that he heard on his last days with us
Smoke alarms

Well the path to the palace of wisdom that the mystics walk
Is lined with neuroleptics and electric shocks
Hope daily for healing
Try not to go insane
Dance in a circle with bells on
Try to make it rain

And nice people say he had gone home to God now
Safe in his arms, safe in his arms
But the voices of the angels singing to him on his last hours with us
Smoke alarms, smoke alarms
============================================================
Picture of My Dress
============================================================
Here at a truck stop in New Mexico
Just before dawn
Somebody's grandma behind the wheel of a big rig
Pulling in with her headlights on
We smoke a cigarette as the sunrise runs riot
Someone's got to break the quiet

And she says: "What are you doing here, anyway?"
And I smile and say: "You'd never guess"
She holds it up for me by its skinny white shoulder-straps
While I take a picture of my dress
I take a picture of my dress

I'm in the bathroom of a Dallas, Texas Burger King
And Mr. Steven Tyler is on the overhead speaker
He doesn't want to miss a thing
Out there at the counter
Blending in with the lunchtime crowd
Trying not to laugh out loud

I eat half my Crispy Chicken Club
I get extra mayonnaise, it's a mess
I take the other half back to the parking lot with me
Pop the trunk, and take a picture of my dress
I take a picture of my dress

It still looks good
I only wore it once
Nine years ago
Nine years, and seven months

It may be a long while
Before the highway decides to finally set me free
I'm gonna have to chase down the remnants
Of something special that you stole from me

It may be hiding in the sunset
Or in distant corners of the dawn
Or maybe it's gone

But I say some prayers above the engine
I bless everything there is to bless
Run out of gas in the middle of nowhere anyway
Stand there by the roadside, smiling
And take a picture of my dress
I take a picture of my dress
I take a picture of my dress

Pigs That Ran Straightaway into the Water, Triumph Of
============================================================
The story of the pigs who ran straightaway into the water and their great triumph

You're gonna send me back to where I came from
Please don't send me back to where I came from
Let me go where the white magnolias grow

You're gonna fit me for that orange jumpsuit
Please don't fit me for that orange jumpsuit
Let me ride where the dragonflies glide

Yeah but you're going to do what you wanna do
No matter what I ask of you
You think you hold the high hand
I've got my doubts
I come from Chino where the asphalt sprouts

Big bus headed southeast from the courthouse
But I'm not headed southeast from the courthouse
Let some mysterious chunk of space debris
Puncture the roof and set me free

And even if I have to go to Claremont
Well I guess I'll just have to go to Claremont
Let me go
Let me lie low

Yeah but you're going to do what you wanna do
No matter what I ask of you
And you send your dark messengers to tempt me
I come from Chino, so all your threats are empty

Pinklon
============================================================
Let the bright colors come blushing gently back to the
Cherry blossom trees, around Pontiac and guys in
Powder blue starter jackets
Down on the street
Let them come up from the corners
So light on their feet

Let the ticker tape come cascading down
Above the greyhound station
Out at the edge of town
And at the schoolyard fences
Where the children shout
Let the chains fall away and let them all rush out

And though all good things in time will melt away
Pinklon Thomas is getting out of prison today

Out to the curbside let the grandmothers come
And stand in red gingham dresses
In the afternoon sun
And from the windows high above the street
Let the trumpets sound
And let confetti fill the air and gather on the ground

Let the guys all hurry on down to the gym
And throw the doors wide open
And clear a space for him
Let messages from strangers
Spray-painted on cheap drapes
Hang from all the fire escapes

Let them spell it out on marquees and on window displays
Pinklon Thomas is getting out of prison today

Pirates (So Long Lonely Avenue)
============================================================
Come on Joey, get out of school
We got places to go
A '67 Lincoln and we got a radio that hurts
And the girls like to touch it
Just to find out if it works
It wasn't me
Don't look at me

Joey lives on the edge of the corner
Of living on the run
I like to ride in the middle
I'm just trying to have some fun
Until the pirates come
Until the pirates come to take me

And I don't need a pilot
Got a pirate who might sail
Somewhere far away I heard
You answer me
So I'm holding on
To your rainbow sleeves

Well goodbye boys
Oh my buddy boys
Oh my sad-eyed Sinatras
It's a cold cold world beyond the sea
You can keep the coat I bought you
And I know you'll get the chance to make it
And nothing's gonna stop you
You just reach right out and take it
And you'll say so long lonely avenue
Yeah you'll say so long lonely avenue
I will see you

Plain
============================================================
Missoula, Montana, 1984
The year of big government taking over
The river gleams with sunlight
New wave bliss under patchy fog tonight

The strands of your hair fell
Opened your eyes, the start of a spell
The perpetual movement gleam in your eye
The cut your hair, length of your stride

We're plain, so plain
Just look the other way
Do you want to stay
Stay with me

Walk home from work, it's bitter and cold
No 4x4s spinning out of control
But nothing much gets over these mountain tops
Snow in the street and the moon in the sky
Is like a fish's eye, it's scaly and gray
Its rays and my cigarette are lighting my way
I walk home from work, it's bitter and cold
And I'll never know what it's like to grow old

You're plain, so plain
Just look the other way
Do you want to stay
Stay with me

Time's past, I'm becoming a man
Or so says the clock that defines who I am
I might not have changed enough to meet any new needs
Might've changed too much to do what I used to
But you're stuck with me, stuck with this
It will never relent, and I'll never miss
I'm part of your kiss, I'm inside you now
The coarse and the rough get alighted somehow

You're plain, so plain
Just look the other way
Do you want to stay with me
So plain
Just look the other way
Do you want to stay
And stay with me

I can't stand it when you tell our infant son
That he was born beneath a bad sign
And I can't stand it when smiles up at you
Just because you're his mother
And I can't stand the bitter thing that I've become
Between the four walls that hold up our ceiling
And I wonder when the house gets real quiet
Who between us will be the first one to give into the feeling

And I know, I know you don't want me to hurt you tonight
And I, I don't want you to hurt me the way you do

I can't stand it when you put the boy to bed and you
Sing him those songs I used to sing to you
Yeah I can't stand to hear you sing those songs
When you know you don't mean them
And I can't stand the way my body still remembers
How much we used to mean to one another way back when
And I can't stand going back to seek the shelter of your arms
And then I can't stand it again

And I know, I know you don't want me to hurt you tonight
And I, I don't want you to hurt me the way you do

When I wake up I crawl on all fours to the kitchen
And I admire myself in the dish of water on the floor
These summer mornings, they can't last forever, you know
There's gonna come a day, come a day
When no one here can stand it anymore

The stench and the overwhelming noise
Pull the truck up to the front
Drive 'em in boys, drive 'em in boys
Drive 'em in

So when I hear them coming I try to stand up but I fall down, I fall down
And I smash my nose against the counter as I go
Blood splashes on the tiles
And I wanna clean it up
But there isn't time to clean it up is there
Things are bad for us right now
Things are gonna be bad for awhile

Yeah the stench and the overwhelming noise
Pull the truck up to the door
Drive 'em in boys, drive 'em in boys
Drive 'em in
============================================================
Positive Jam
============================================================
Woke up in the 20s
There were flappers and fruits in white suits
It was right before the crash
We got thrashed throughout the 30s
Queuing up for soup in scabby sores
And then they sent us off to war

Came back in the 40s
There were wheelchairs, guns, and ticker-tape
We poured it on the floor and we made love through the interstate
Got shiftless in the 50s
Holding hands and going steady
Twisting into the dark parts of big Midwestern cities
Tripped right through the 60s with some blissful little hippie
Some Kennedys got shot while you were screwing San Francisco
And the 70s got heavy
We woke up on bloody carpets
Got tangled up in gaslines
And I guess that's where it started

And the 80s almost killed me
Let's not recall them quite so fondly
Some Kennedys O.D.'d while we watched on MTV
In the 90s we were wired and well-connected
Put it all down on technology and lost everything we invested

We're gonna start out with a positive jam
We're gonna start out with a positive jam
I got bored when I didn't have a band
So I called up Peter Hughes, man
We're gonna start out with a positive jam

And all the sniffling indie kids
Hold steady
All the clustered up clever kids
Hold steady
============================================================
Possum By Night
============================================================
When the house lights all go dark
Shuffle on down to the park
Spent stars in the winter sky
Days of refuge in short supply

All you parasites climb aboard
All you vagabonds praise the Lord

When the compost pile grows high
Climb to the top if I try
Long haul truckers still wide awake
Guard their pathways for Jesus' sake

All you garbage trucks to the curb
True sons of the living word

Try not to get stuck in the intake vent
Grow fat, and grow old, and go blind, and be content

All your pack dogs have your say
Let me just find my own way
Moon in the trees my guide
Walk with my jaw hinged wide

Once more unto the breach
Safe in the spots that the light can't reach
============================================================
Prana Ferox
============================================================
I went down to the basement
To check up on the sour mash
I looked down to the nonreactive ceramic tub
It was bubbling
I had stirred up the dust on the stairs coming down
I saw the dust devils swarming around
Incoming sun beams cut them apart
And I watched a shadow pass across my heart
You were upstairs in the kitchen with your head against the sink
Trying to cool down
Trying to cool down

I know you don't believe me, but I could hear you breathing
I looked into the tub and there the mixture was seething
With new life
New life all around
I had stirred up the dust on the stairs coming down
You were upstairs in the kitchen with your head against the sink
Trying to cool down
Trying to cool down
Yeah

There's terror in terror city, oh yeah
There's terror in terror city, oh yeah
Terror in the face of the animal, oh yeah
The animal who is looking at you

There's terror in terror city, oh yeah
Terror in terror city, oh yeah
Terror in the face of the animal, oh yeah
The animal who is looking at you

There's terror in terror city, oh yeah
Terror in terror city, oh yeah
Terror in the face of the animal, oh yeah
The animal who is looking at you

Process of Elimination
============================================================
In Sicily, it's awfully hot
But where we were most decidedly not
So I looked around
I saw heaven coming down
Around you

In Washington, it's cold as ice
And we were warm in the arms of Christ himself
I took a long look at your face
I saw the angel take his place
Beside you

There's monsoons in Kashmir
I was worried that you'd disappear
I touched your arm just to be on the safe side and the world
Broke apart and fell off by the wayside
Next to you
============================================================
Programmed Cell Death
============================================================
Up and down the shining aisles
The all-night grocery store on Melrose
Dozens of us exiles from the mothership
The whole wide western world is at our fingertips

But while the moon hangs high above the city
And while the night begins to flex its jaws
We meet up like a loose-knit congregation
Or like spies who need to pass on information

How much longer are we supposed to stay alive
Gathering by the Portuguese sardines in aisle five

Mounds of California avocados
Like offerings to an unresponsive god
I wore my suit from Hong Kong to the store tonight
'Cause it fits me just right

And suddenly the lights out in the parking lot
Begin to burst like sodas under pressure
One by one they throw themselves against the night sky
And almost unremarked upon the moment passes by

The one or two of us
Point our fingers outside
Eyes glazed, mouths wide

Listening to that still small voice within us
Doesn't seem to do us any good
Try to take that in stride
And try to let the moment slide

And we fiddle with our cellphones
Until our thumbs are sore
And the music on the speakers overhead
Is fainter than the voices of the dead

How much longer are we supposed to stay alive
Gathering by the Portuguese sardines in aisle five
============================================================
Prominent Metaphysicians of South Pomona

Mohawk Dan is sleeping in a park off Holt and Garry
He's staying out of trouble til his fractured ulna heals
There's gonna be a party at the Travelodge on Mission
He says he's gonna try to make it, it depends on how he feels

And we are all
Headed out
All putting on a brave face
We are all
Heading home
Into the incandescent heart of this place

Sandy is in the Dodge Dart and the tags ran out in April
She tries to keep it local but she's the only car we've got
She wants to move to San Francisco, everybody's gonna move to San Francisco
But the bottleneck near Ventura, we are one great, commmunal bloodclot

And we are all
Headed out
All putting on a brave face
We are all
Heading home
Into the incandescent light of this place

Three of us are dead, two of us are missing
One's been sent to Utah, one's joined the Catholic Church
There's a California condor hungry as an orphan
Dark eyes scanning through our ranks hunched up on his perch

And we are all
Headed out
All putting on a brave face
We are all
Heading home
Into the incandescent light of this place

Proverbs 6:27
============================================================
Try to hide down in the darkness
Get accustomed to our shapes
Reined in 'til next week at the earliest
Go through an old box full of betamax tapes

Pull the blankets up to my neck
And the screen began to glow
I cried real tears when they beat Chuck Norris down
Wait here in the shadows 'til the shadows let me go

And treat each crushing moment like a gift
And wait for the fog to lift

Pretend I'm waiting for a notice
From someone somewhere far away
Sit here and break things while I'm waiting
As day gives way to day gives way to day gives way to day

But though I try to let the shadows mask my movements
They're never gonna hide me like they used to
I watch the Delta Force save everybody from that plane on fire
I was watching wishing I had not lost track of you

I treat each crushing moment like a gift
And wait for the fog to lift
============================================================
Prowl Great Cain
============================================================
Gather jewels from graveyards,
when I get home bury them again
Wonder if you'll ever get the chance
to ask me why I turned you in
I saved my own skin but I live to fight,
I live to fight another day
Still remember how brave you were
when they came to take you away

And I feel guilty
but I can't feel ashamed
Prowl through empty fields, great Cain

Thought I'd seen the ghost up on the
boulevard, between the broken bits
It's hard to tell gifts of the spirit
from clever counterfeits.
Sleepwalk through my days and mark
the hours until these dark times fade
Like a caterpillar crawling
out along the surface of the blade

And I feel guilty
but I can't feel ashamed
Prowl through empty fields, great Cain

Rummage through the gutted
storehouse now
And lick the sweat from my brow
Saw the trucks roll out this morning,
not sure when they're
coming back again
Feel the prickings of my conscience
in my chest every now and then

Sometimes a great wave
of forgetfulness
rises up and blesses me
And other times the sickness howls
and I despair of any remedy

And I feel guilty
but I can't feel ashamed
Prowl through empty fields, great Cain
============================================================
Psalms 40:2
============================================================
Pulled off the highway in Missouri
And lo, our hearts were heavy laden
Made for the chapel with some spray paint
For all the things we'd held in secret

Lord, lift up these lifeless bones
Light cascading through the windows
All the rainbow's heavy tones

He has fixed his sign in the sky
He has raised me from the pit and set me high

Left that place in ruin
Drunk on the spirit and high on fumes
Checked into a Red Roof Inn
Stayed up for several hours and then slept like infants

In the burning fuselage of my days
Let my mouth be ever fresh with praise

He has fixed his sign in the sky
He has raised me from the pit and set me high

Each morning new
Each day shot through
With all the sharp, small shards of shrapnel
That seem to burst out of me and you

Head down toward Kansas
We will get there when we get there, don't you worry
Feel bad about the things we do along the way
But not really that bad

We inhaled the frozen air
Lord, send me a mechanic if I'm not beyond repair

He has fixed his sign in the sky
He has raised me from the pit and he will set me high
============================================================
Pseudothyrum Song
============================================================
Why do you treat me this way
And why do you try so hard to break my spirit
I think someone was mean to you when you were little
That's what I think
I think someone was mean to you

Why do you cling to such petty points of contention
And why don't you allow me one or two small victories now and then
I think someone was mean to you when you didn't deserve it
That's what I think
I think someone was mean to you

But I
I am not that guy, can you get that straight
I am a completely different person
From the one you have in mind

Why do you stand by the things you say long after
You don't mean to hurt anybody anymore
I think someone was mean to you
For a long, long time
That's what I think
I think someone was mean to you

Puffin’ on a pot pipe
Puffin’ on a pot pipe
Puffin’ on a pot pipe

Feeling my head tight
It’s a celebration
Feeling my brains a light
A mental masturbation
Skin’s falling down the drain
I’ll pretend I’m insane

Puffin’ on a pot pipe
Puffin’ on a pot pipe
Puffin’ on a pot pipe

Say man where’s the light
Puffin’ on a pot pipe
Maybe I’m just uptight
Puffin’ on a pot pipe
Maybe I’m an asshole
Maybe you’re just too stoned
Oh I’m too stoned!

Puffin’ on a pot pipe
Puffin’ on a pot pipe
Puffin’ on a pot pipe
Puffin’ on a pot pipe
Puffin’ on a pot pipe
Puffin’ on a pot pipe
Puffin’ on a pot pipe
Puffin’ on a pot pipe

Roll another doobie
Very soon we will be
Feeling scarijuana might
Puffin’ on a pot pipe

Pure Crystal
============================================================
The cactus cuttings took root
The tea you brought me smacked of passion fruit
In a room where the heat bled in through the wall
I lay breathing in the design of it all
What is there to regret
Your mouth was wet
And your shoulders rolled under mine

I saw the glaze come over your eyes
I felt my blood pumping and the heat rise
I've seen pretty eyes before, but never like those
And your body opened like a new rose
What more is there to say
The air gave way
I was melting and sweltering under you
============================================================
Pure Dynamite
============================================================
There is a certain feeling in your bones when you crawl
There is a certain something singing in your blood when you roll around
There is a special light that shines
On the birds that you see through your window
And you say "pure dynamite"
And you say "pure dynamite"

That fiery sound that comes from somewhere in your system
It's familiar to you, animal justice came down once not long ago
And now the atmosphere is charged with bad intentions
And you breathe in sharply
And you say "pure dynamite"
And you say "pure dynamite"
Lisa is in here somewhere
There is very little doubt in your mind about that now
She has left the smell of sulfur in the air
That comes through the clogged pores of the screen
And you know pure dynamite this time
============================================================
Pure Gold
============================================================
Hey don't touch the door
Because the door will surely kill you
I hear you saying that you don't see what I mean
Well you better look again

Stop looking at the floor
'Cause the whole building's turning and turning and turning
And don't touch the door
Can't you see the door's burning

And all at once the street is filled with light
And all at once the street is filled with sound
When I hold you I know our number's being called somewhere
Let them come on down
============================================================
Pure Heat
============================================================
The wind from the north
Fattens the yellow corn
You come into the house
With your dress torn
I can see you now
As through a screen
A smile on your face
Your fingers dripping kerosene

Your hair hangs down
Over me
Your hair casts a shadow
To cover me
I can see you now
As through a screen
The smile on your face
Your fingers dripping kerosene

And the wind from the north
Cools me
The wind from the north
Doesn't fool me
I can see you now
As through a screen
A smile on your face
Your fingers dripping kerosene
============================================================
Pure Honey
============================================================
I had a thousand good questions
I was gonna ask you when you finally came by
But now that you're really here
There's only one question that comes to my mind
And that question being
What's with all the Portuguese water dogs
I'd like to repeat the question
What's with all the Portuguese water dogs
============================================================
Pure Intentions
============================================================
You're a strong one, you're a lion
You're brave and death defying
You're in your car crossing town
And I can feel you coming down

You're so pretty I could burst
And I wonder who's gonna talk first
My muscles all shaking and blood's turned to foam
It's Tuesday, and you're coming home
Yeah
============================================================
Pure Love
============================================================
Hey, what's wrong with you
Hey, what are you trying to do
Because if what you had in mind
Is what I think it is, then it's not very kind
It won't be necessary
It won't be necessary now
It won't be necessary
It won't be necessary now

Hey, what are you doing my love
Hey, didn't I just tell you that such a thing would be over and above
What's called for in this case
Pull the ski mask away from your face
It won't be necessary
It won't be necessary now
It won't be necessary
It won't be necessary now
It won't be necessary
It won't be necessary now
============================================================
Pure Milk
============================================================
Moon's full, and the sky is bright
And so you and me are gonna get drunk tonight
We're gonna steal some tractors and head on into town
Find the main strip and start mowing them down

Don't come to the window 'til you're sure it's me
Don't ignore the obvious, take a deep breath
Put your hand on the goddamn radio
Put your hand on the goddamn radio

Fields are full of spirits, but no one cares at all
And the light above you flickers when you hear me call
And I'm shaking when I see you there cause I don't know what it means
But the ground is looking dry tonight, bursting near the seams

So don't come to the window 'til you're sure it's me
Don't ignore the obvious, take a deep breath
Put your hand on the goddamn radio
Put your hand on the goddamn radio, yeah
============================================================
Pure Money
============================================================
Waves crashed all around and near your body
The waves came all over you
And I saw the sky reflected on the ocean
Deadly blue
Yeah, I used to know you
I used to know you
I used to know you
I used to know you
I used to know you
============================================================
Pure Sound
============================================================
The air was cooling down
The sky was blue
I was heading north on Taylor Street
When I ran into you
We stopped to talk
Right there on the sidewalk
The air was new and clean
I was in between times

The mountains were clearly visible
And your timing was cruel
You said almost everything right
And your eyes shone like little jewels
We were talking
While the temperature dropped
I was hoping against hope
That the wheel would stop
You were nineteen
I was in between times
Hey
============================================================
Pure Sun
============================================================
Outside the Federal District
30 miles away
We saw the sunlight strike the sundial
We saw the sundial disappear
Shooting off the river's body
Little tributaries flowing
Wild amaranth growing

It was quiet for a minute
Then a plane passed overhead
It was flying far too low to the ground
I felt the wind brush by my hair
Shooting off the river's body
Little tributaries glowing
Wild amaranth growing

Your hair was getting dirty
I felt your fingers stroke my ribs
I felt you brushing up against me
I let my concentration slip
I swear the new day
I swear the new day's coming
Wild amaranth growing
============================================================
Pure Vampire

Vampire love

Don't need your vampire love

I don’t want your vampire love

Yeah

Quetzalcoatl Comes Through
============================================================
He came spitting fire
On a day like no other
Tried to hold you near to me
I heard him passing over
He made a banquet for the stray dogs of the air
He put our love in clear perspective

Blue, red, and green plumage
Trailing behind him now
Swaddling the sky in its aftermath
The last day coming down
He made a banquet for the stray dogs of the air
He put our love in clear perspective
Rising, rising, rising, rising
============================================================
Quetzalcoatl Eats Plums
============================================================
I meant to leave the house this morning
And begin making my way toward where you are
I meant to leave the house this morning
I made it halfway across the front yard

But the plum tree hung heavy in my head
And the plum tree hung heavy in my heart
And the plum tree hung heavy over me

So I tore off to the phone
To call you and tell you something, but I couldn't remember what
Because through the clean, clean windows
Saw the plum tree's leaves, as red as fresh blood

And the plum tree hung heavy in my head
And the plum tree hung heavy in my heart
And the plum tree hung heavy over me
============================================================
Quetzalcoatl is Born
============================================================
(He touched me and suddenly...)

It's a cold night in Sonora
And the stars are out in full force
It's a moment the world has been waiting for
When you set the world back on course
Into the fire you go
Into the fire you go

It's a strange gathering around you
And the lord of the snails is born
Five minutes before you take on divinity
You hear the crackling, well you hear the snapping corn
Into the fire you go
Into the fire you go
Into the fire you go
Into the fire you go
============================================================
Quito
============================================================
When I receive the blessing I've got coming
I'm going to raise an ice-cold glass of water
And toast the living and the dead who've gone before me
And my head will throb like an old wound reopening

When I get off the bus down there my children
They all are going to greet me at the station
Like gypsies they will dance around me
And the choral droning sound their voices make will saturate the evening

When I get off the wheel I'm going to stop
And make amends to everyone I've wounded
And when I wave my magic wand
Those few who've slipped the surly bonds will rise like salmon at the spawning
============================================================
Quién Como Tú
============================================================
El perfume de su almohada, tu lo conoces bien
Y la humedad de sus sabanas blancas también
Que suerte la tuya que puedes tenerlo a tus pies
Sintiendo en tu boca sus besos que saben a miel

Mirando como le hablas de amor el tiempo no se detiene
Y nada tengo yo que esperar aunque me quede en el aire

Quién como tú, que día a día puedes tenerle
Quién como tú, que solo entre tus brazos se duerme
Quién como tú
Que con ternura cura sus fiebres
Quién como tú

Esas noches de locura, tu las disfrutas bien
Y entre sus brazos las horas no pasan lo se

Mirando como le hablas de amor el tiempo no se detiene
Y nada tengo yo que esperar aunque me quede en el aire

Quién como tú, que día a día puedes tenerle
Quién como tú, que solo entre tus brazos se duerme
Quién como tú
Que con ternura cura sus fiebres
Quién como tú

Radical Evil Song
============================================================
I wind up the tiny machines
I watch them go
I don't know what they are exactly
What do I know

I know that you are the radical evil
I've been wondering about
I know that you are the radical evil
I've been wondering about

I read the words the clouds spell on the sky
I watch them burn up
Then I see you turn up
In the corner of the room
I knew you'd be stopping by soon

'Cause you are the radical evil
I've been wondering about
I know that you are the radical evil
I've been wondering about
============================================================
Rage of Travers
============================================================
Close the balcony at the Rainbow
Because the promoter says so
Aviators and a buckskin frontier hat
How come they dress like that?
They break the news to me so gentle
But I start to feel sentimental
This used to be the place to go
Still draw pretty good in Ontario

Nobody wants to hear the twelve bar blues
From a guy in platform shoes

Let's just have a good time when the show's done
Ask where the good clubs are and go find one
Roll up to the curb
Spill out of the car
Everyone's dressed up like corpses
I brought my guitar
Set it down by the stage
The singer's locked up in a steel cage
Shaking the bars
Eyes wild with fear
I don't belong here

Nobody wants to hear the twelve-bar blues
From a guy in platform shoes
============================================================
Raid on Entebbe
============================================================
On the shores of a lake named after a late queen of England
I heard new rumors of war
The sun was a red ball up in the summer sky
I saw my sister standing in the doorway
She had that look on her face that reminded me of you
The reports were coming hourly and the sky was blue
They were shifting the power again
They always do this when I come home

I tucked my shirt in though I don't know why
Shielded my eyes from the light up in the sky
'Cause it was shining, blazing like a highway flare
In the incredibly, impossibly dry air
I heard my mother call my sister to the kitchen again
And thought that everything was headed straight down the drain
They positioned themselves in strategic locations
I was beginning to lose my patience
If you'll just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
============================================================
Rain Song
============================================================
The rain came down, soaked the old Hibachi
And I wish I could sing like Allen Callaci
And then you would know
How sad it was, when the rain came down

Drop by drop, gallon by gallon
Brother if I could sing, if I could sing like Allen
You would know and understand
How sad it was when the rain came down
============================================================
Rain in Soho
============================================================
No one knows where the lone wolf sleeps
No one sees the hidden treasure in the castle keep
No one learns the secret name
No one burns in the absent flame
No one broke D.B. Cooper’s fall
No one hopes to hear the bagman call
Children piping in the main square
But no one’s dancing
No one’s dancing down there

The river goes where the water flows
But no one knows when the Batcave closed
The river goes where the water flows
But no one knows when the Batcave closed

No promise sweeter than a blood pact
Nothing harder to go through with than a vanishing act
No morning colder than the first frost
No friends closer than the ones we’ve lost
Nothing sharper than a serpent’s tooth
Nothing harder than the gospel truth
Though you repent and don sackcloth and try to make nice
You can’t cross the same river twice

The river goes where the water flows
But no one knows when the Batcave closed
The river goes where the water flows
But no one knows when the Batcave closed

There’s a club where you’d like to go
You could meet someone who’s lost like you
Revel in the darkness like a pair of open graves
Fumble through the fog for a season or two

No town more barren than our town
No haven safer than the one they tore down
No greater love than to lay my life down for a friend
No sweeter pleasure than to see the credits clear through to the end
No one knows where the lone wolf’s gone
No one sees him camped out right there on the front lawn
We played for you but you would not sing
No one was gonna get away with anything

The river goes where the water flows
But no one knows when the Batcave closed
The river goes where the water flows
But no one knows when the Batcave closed
============================================================
Rainbow in the Dark
============================================================
When there's lightning, you know it always brings me down
'Cause it's free and I see that it's me
Who's lost and never found
I cry out for magic, I feel it dancing in the night
It was cold, lost my hold
To the shadows of the night

There's no sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark

Do your demons, do they ever let you go
When you've tried, deep inside, just to hide
Is it someone that you know
You're just a picture, you're an image lost in time
We're a lie, you and I
We're words without a rhyme

There's no sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark

When I see lightning, you know it always brings me down
'Cause it's free and I see that it's me
Who's lost and never found

There's no sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow
============================================================
Raja Vocative
============================================================
A bird you would've liked brought the sky down
But it was useless to see it without you around
And in the unstoppable camera of my mind's eye
I saw you and some foreign guy

And I could hear your voice ringing
I could hear you singing
From all the way across the country in Palm Springs
I can hear you now

Your laughter tore through the New Jersey night
And I can't stand it that I'm alright
Stood out on the balcony and I took a look around
And a bird we would've loved the sight of brought the sky down

And I can hear your voice ringing
I can hear you singing
From all the way across the country in Palm Springs
I can hear you now
============================================================
Rat Queen
============================================================
Meek subjects by torchlight come to pay their respects
As foretold by the ancient texts
Line snaking down the sewer
Reverent hush upon the crowd
One by on we approach
The figure in the shroud

New dreams
New dreams for the rat queen
New dreams
New dreams for the rat queen

Great warm throbbing hum of the undercity
At one with the purpose
I am a faceless, nameless acolyte
Here tonight at your service
Take my visions, make them real
Impose them on the world above
All the dead sleepwalkers
Who never learned how to love

New dreams
New dreams for the rat queen
New dreams
New dreams for the rat queen

Brand new dreams, great visions
Something heady and threatening
On the boil in the kitchen

Arise from the storm-drains, take to the streets
We who've never once tasted the stench of defeat
Victory sweet as the dregs of the fast-food dumpster
Look how they jump when we show up
Like they've just seen a monster

New dreams
New dreams for the rat queen
New dreams
New dreams for the rat queen
============================================================
Real Good Girlfriend
============================================================
I woke up this morning
With my new girlfriend beside me
I don't have to lie about her
I don't need some dumb story to hide me
She turned twenty last April, she's as tall as I am
Came to this country all the way from Siam
I may not be the greatest guy in this town
People may have good cause to put me down
But I've got a real good girlfriend now

We stood on Chicago Avenue
And look, here comes the bus
Slipped on a solid sheet of ice
Watched the number 66 fly right past us
I may not be the greatest guy in this town
People may have good cause to put me down
But I got a real good girlfriend
I got a real good girlfriend
I got a real good girlfriend now
============================================================
Rebel Girl
============================================================
That girl thinks she's the queen of the neighborhood
She's got the hottest trike in town
That girl she holds her head up so high
I think I wanna be her best friend

Rebel girl rebel girl
Rebel girl you are the queen of my world
Rebel girl rebel girl
I think I wanna take you home
I wanna try on your clothes, girl

When she walks, the revolution's coming
In her hips, there's revolution
When she talks, I hear the revolution
In her kiss, we kiss the revolution
Rebel girl rebel girl
Rebel girl you are the queen of my world
Rebel girl rebel girl
I know I wanna take you home
I wanna try on your clothes, girl

That girl thinks she's the queen of the neighborhood
I got news for you
She is
They say she's a slut but I know
She is my best friend
Rebel girl rebel girl
Rebel girl you are the queen of my world
Rebel girl rebel girl
I know I wanna take you home
I wanna try on your clothes, girl

I really like you, I really love you
I really wanna be your best friend
Love you like a sister always
Soul sister blood sister
Please be my rebel girl

As we pull into the harbor in New York today
I ask you how you're doing, you swear up and down you're okay
But I can see what's gotten into your eyes
It's written all over your face tonight
We will never see Ireland again
We will never see Ireland again

As we hang up the map on the motel wall
Count up the places that we've left behind
Add the distances between them all
All the bridges someone's burned down for us
All the chances that we burned all by ourselves
Makes us wonder what we were thinking then
'Cause we will never see Ireland again
We will never see Ireland again
We will never see Ireland again

Red River Valley
============================================================
From this valley they say you are going
We will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile
For they say you are taking the sunshine
That it brightened our pathways a while

Come and sit by my side if you love me
Do not hasten to bid me adieu
But remember the Red River Valley
And the cowboy who loved you so true

Come and sit by my side if you love me
Do not hasten to bid me adieu
But remember the Red River Valley
And the cowboy who loved you so true

Reel Around the Fountain
============================================================
It's time the tale were told
Of how you took a child
And you made him old

It's time that the tale were told
Of how you took a child
And you made him old

Reel around the fountain
Slap me on the patio
I'll take it now

Fifteen minutes with you
Oh, I wouldn't say no
Oh, people said that you were virtually dead
But they were so wrong

Fifteen minutes with you
Oh, I wouldn't say no
People see no worth in you
Yeah, well I do

I dreamt about you last night
And I fell out of bed twice
You can pin and mount me
Like a butterfly

But take me to the haven of your bed
Was something that you never said
Two lumps please, you're the bee's knees
But so am I

Reel around the fountain
Slap me on the patio
I'll take it slowly

Fifteen minutes with you
Oh, I wouldn't say no
People said that you were virtually dead
Well, they were so wrong

Fifteen minutes with you
Oh, I wouldn't say no
People see no worth in you
Yeah, well I do
Oh, I do

Rescue Breathing
============================================================
Soothing sound of traffic from the freeway
Bright white Pomona moon
That Triple Zero that we got in Costa Mesa
Turning golden as a sunrise on the spoon

It was the warmest feeling in the world
When the ghost rose in my throat
It matched the sweetest sound you’d ever heard
Note for note

You came down to meet me on the floor
Splashing that cold water on my head
Holding my eyelids open with your thumbs
Bringing me back from the dead

It was the warmest feeling in the world
A crystal clear signal reaching from the station
There was no tenderness, no good night kiss
Just mouth-to-mouth resuscitation

I had a blanket wrapped around my shoulders
You had a dream of all the oceans in your eyes
No thing on earth could quite nail our coffin shut
Every time that we went under we would rise

It was the warmest feeling in the world
And you were the warmest thing to walk its surface
Easing me painlessly all the way down to the furnace
All the way into the furnace
============================================================
Resonant Bell World
============================================================
Sometimes you're a starling
Sometimes you're a kite
You're a hyena from early to mid afternoon
You're a stray dog at night

It's the most amazing thing I've ever seen
How you will not act like a human being

When you put on your special coat
And you made your special lunge for my throat
Between you and me
It was—it was really exciting

It's the most alarming thing I've ever seen
How you will not act like a human being
It's the most incredible thing I've ever seen
How you refuse to act like a human being
In the starlight
In the starlight
In the starlight
In the starlight
In the starlight
In the starlight
In the starlight
In the starlight

Come on baby, bring the bib
We'll scarf down some scrumptious ribs

We'll go down to Alta Loma

Come on baby

Come on baby, you and me-a
We'll scarf down those warm costillas
Ribdate!

I know you're the sloppy type
So don't forget the handi-wipe
Ribdate!

Yeah

Riches and Wonders
============================================================
we live high, our love gorges on the alcohol we feed it.
and it grows all fat and friendly
we have surplus if we need it.
we hold on as hard as we can.
our knuckles are white.
we write letters to each other, invent secrets to confess to.
I learn foreign and exotic terms of endearment by which to address you.
we feed fresh fruit to one another.
we stay up all night.
I am healthy, I am whole, but I have poor impulse control.
and I want to go home.
but I am home.

we are strong, we are faithful,
we are guardians of a rare thing.
we pay close careful attention to the news the morning air brings.
we show great loyalty to the hard times we've been through.
we are filled with riches and wonders,
our love keeps the things it finds.
and we dance like drunken sailors, lost at sea out of our minds.
you find shelter somewhere in me,
I find great comfort in you.
and I keep you safe from harm.
you hold me in your arms, and I want to go home.
but I am home

Rig Veda, Opulent
============================================================
the burning sun will tear us down
the burning sun will scorch our skin
well it's so lovely on the ground
it's so nice that you're around
see the crystal burn within
and the cold air getting thin where we are

i touch your skin i see your body

yeah the burning sun is new
it's so bright and so are you
and i hear the humming voices
of the people passing through
i have always known these noises
and the kingdom of the toys is
coming down to where we are

i touch your skin i see your body

Ripple
============================================================
If my words did sing with voice of sunshine
And my tunes were played on the harp unstrung
Would you hear my voice come through the music
Would you hold it close as it were your own

It's a hand-me-down, the thoughts are broken
Perhaps it's better left unsung
And I don't know, don't really care
Let there be songs to fill the air

Ripple in still water
Where there is no pebble tossed
Nor wind to blow

Reach out your hand if your cup be empty
If your cup be full, may it be again
Let it be known there is a fountain
That was not made by the hands of men

There is a road, no simple highway
Between the dawn and the dark of night
And if you go, no one may follow
That path is for your steps alone

You who choose to lead must follow
But if you fall, you fall alone
If you should stand, then who's to guide you
If I knew the way, I would take you home
============================================================
Rise Above It
============================================================
My sweetheart's gone and left me
And my little sister, too
And I'm left alone in sadness
Don't know what to do, don't know what to do

I don't want your greenback dollar
Don't want your watch and chain
All I want is you, my darling
Won't you take me back?
Rise above it, rise above it.

Rockin' Rockin' Pet Store
============================================================
One burning afternoon, under the waxing jurisdiction of the harvest moon
We took a ride, we went far away
And I remember it as though it were yesterday
At the pet store

The stereo played songs we both knew
And I reached my arm around to touch you
I felt the sun burning into me
And I knew we'd find the physic for my malady
At the pet store

Your hair caught the sunlight as you opened the door
And I'd never seen your hair looking quite that way before
I heard the parakeets punctuate the moment with their
Shrieks and cries
I saw the reptile cages reflected in your blue eyes
Their green bodies conspiring therein
To form a separate universe where it was no sin
To want what I wanted right then and there
In the pet store
============================================================
Rockin' Rockin' Twilight of the Gods
============================================================
Switched on the radio this morning
And heard about the local savings and loan
How they went under
Took with them everything I own
That's alright
It doesn't make me nervous
But I can see the clouds gathering in the distance

And every time it rains, it rains pennies from heaven
Yeah every time it rains, I'm a rich man
Yeah every time it rains, I'm indescribably wealthy
Yeah every time it rains, gold coins spill from the heavens straight into my hands
Many have said the devil was coming
I looked down at the sidewalk through the window
Three inches of water running

I looked up at the clouds and everything looked great
The Financial News Network talked about the prime lending rate
That's alright
I'm safe and warm
Just over there you know, near South Ontario
I can see the signals of a tropical storm

And every time it rains, it rains pennies from heaven
Yeah every time it rains, I'm a rich man
Yeah every time it rains, I'm indescribably wealthy
Every time it rains, blank checks fall from the heavens straight into my hands
Many have said that the devil was coming
I looked down at the sidewalk through the window
Three inches of water running
============================================================
Rocks in My Pockets
============================================================
Like a good luck charm for a soldier
Heading off into battle
I carried a stone in my pocket
Something I found in Seattle

It vaguely resembled a face
And it looked like a headstone a little
Deep groove from a worm or from years underwater
Running right down the middle

Some people name their cars, or their guitars
Some things are too fragile to name
Some things are made for the spotlight
Some live at the edge of the frame

Just a few days above surface
A lifetime below
Rocks in my pockets when I go

Stuck to the shoreline
In the light of the torch
Wrapped up in your bandage
Like a package on the porch

You were never going to make it
I felt like you knew
But at least you'll have someone
For some of us that won't be true

Some people go down swinging, get in a few punches
Some learn to ride the currents, some never learn
Probably not going to leave the slightest trace in the wake
When it's my turn

Tie down the sails
When the crosswinds blow
Rocks in my pockets when I go

Initials in the bark of a tree
Little signs of hope
Like a good luck charm for a soldier
Mailed home in an envelope

Some people go it alone
Some need a friend
The weak ones get lucky
The strong ones stick around to see the end

Just a few days above surface
A lifetime below
Rocks in my pockets when I go
Rocks in my pockets when I go
Rocks in my pockets when I go

Roger Patterson Van
============================================================
Kelly said the van was streaked with broken signs of you
Tapes and magazines, all your goodness beaming through
Sorting through your suitcase by the highway in the sun
Somewhere in Louisiana when you really need to run, your legs
Will bend and buckle, there is nowhere to go
So you walk sideways

Two sad young men one February, digging through a wreck
Cleaning out the tour van, check and double check
Nothing left inside now, nothing left to do
Empty out the empties, half this stuff belongs to you
When you load out something heavy, you've gotta watch your back
So you walk sideways

Sideways
Sideways
============================================================
Romans 10:9
============================================================
Wake up sixty minutes after my head hits the pillow, I can't live like this
And in the shower I am a sailor standing waiting, ready for the ship to list
Everything looks burned up, I'm too scared to look around
Don't feel like going on, but come on, make a joyful sound

If you will believe in your heart
And confess with your lips
Surely you will be saved one day

Try to think of ways to fix myself but everything ends in a cul-de-sac
The beast broke from the barn while we were sleeping, face it, face it, he's not coming back
Don't see what the point is in even trying to fight
Look for the bigger picture when I close my eyes real tight

If you will believe in your heart
And confess with your lips
Surely you will be saved one day

Look for the sign of Daniel
Consider the clues
Wait as long as I have to for good news

Wake and rise and face the day and try to stop the day from staring back at me
Busy hours for joyful hearts and later maybe head out to the pharmacy
Won't take the medication but it's good to have around
A kind and loving God won't let my small ship run aground

If you will believe in your heart
And confess with your lips
Surely you will be saved one day

Rotten Stinking Mouthpiece
============================================================
lob some spit at the window
watch it run down the pane
it's only the guilty
who concern themselves
with clearing their names

you bring tidings of hope,
false tidings
when you come here
there's two friends who did me wrong
that you're protecting
it's so clear

and when you speak it's those two
who speak through you
who'll speak for me?
the burning and the electricity

sun goes down San Francisco
friends are hard to find
chew them up just as quick
as I can find them
try to clear my mind

remember hours at the table
gauze flight light easing through
if there's one thing
that I'm not going to do tonight
it's die for you

'cause when you speak it's those two
who speak through you
who'll speak for me
the burning and the electricity

Run Run Rudolph
============================================================
Out of all the reindeer you know you're the mastermind
Run run Rudolph, Santa ain't too far behind
Run run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
Run run Rudolph, tell him he can take the freeway down
Run run Rudolph, reeling like a merry-go-round

Said Santa to a boy child "What have you been longing for?"
All I want for Christmas is a rock and roll electric guitar
And then away went Rudolph, whizzing like a shooting star
Run run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Run run Rudolph, 'cause I'm reeling like a merry-go-round

Said Santa to a girl child "What have you been longing to get?"
A little baby doll that can eat, sleep, drink, and wet
And then away went Rudolph, buzzing like a Saber jet
Run run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Run run Rudolph, reeling like a merry-go-round

Run run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Run run Rudolph, reeling like a merry-go-round, yeah

Running Away with What Freud Said
============================================================
Big city, wide corner
New flowers, cold comfort.
56 Fahrenheit early in the morning
Buses passing by black smoke in their wake
Big surprises, a lot of big surprises
Bones ringing, running away with what Freud said

Same morning, world breathing
Far, far from home
Big ringing in the bones
Whose bones are these? God please
Feel the pumping, feel the fresh blood pump inside
City's living, the city's truly living
What's the difference? Running away with what Freud said
============================================================
Saigon Shrunken Panorama
============================================================
The last vestiges of the empire were crumbling
Daisies were pushing through the ground
And I saw a crane disappear beneath still water
On the day when you came back around
And though time remembers meaningless gestures
Your goodness will not be forgotten while I am still alive
It was the eighteenth day of May
In 1975

And I asked if you could last a week or two
And you said you thought you could
You came inside then with the light trickling behind you
It was fine and it was good
And so gleams the single moment before we heard the officers arrive
On the eighteenth day of May
In 1975
Hey

Sail Babylon Springs
============================================================
And meanwhile downstairs, I'm setting up shop
A little too proud to let the matter drop
And I can hear you up there, isn't it romantic
You're huffing and puffing, rearranging
Deck chairs on the Titanic
And I reach for a glass of cool water drawn
From the rivers of Babylon

And meanwhile outside, the stars have come out
And the humid summer air pulls at the ring in my snout
And you stand at your window looking down
And I spread wide my arms
Jump if you wanna jump, jump if you want to
The water's warm
I know
I know 'cause I've been swimming
Blindly along
Through the rivers of Babylon
============================================================
Sail On
============================================================
Sail on down the road
'Bout a half a mile or so
Well I tried to make you stay
But now you're going
It was plain to see
That a small town boy like me
Just wasn't your cup of tea
That was wishful thinking
I gave you my heart and I tried to make you happy
You gave me nothing in return
You know it ain't so hard to say
"Would you please just go away"

You come to comfort me
But I don't need your sympathy
And the way you look at me
Well it's condescending
I feel my stomach churn
And didn't you ever learn
Not to tell somebody something if you don't mean it
I gave you my heart and I tried to make you happy
You gave me nothing in return
You know it ain't so hard to say
"Would you please just go away"

Sail on
Sail on
Sail on

Sally MacLennane
============================================================
Well, Jimmy played harmonica in the pub where I was born
He played it from the night time to the peaceful early morn
He soothed the souls of psychos and the men who had the horn
And they all looked very happy in the morning

Now Jimmy didn't like his place in this world of ours
Where the elephant man broke strong men's necks
When he'd had too many Powers
So sad to see the grieving of the people that I'm leaving
And he took the road for God knows in the morning

We walked him to the station in the rain
We kissed him as we put him on the train
And we sang him a song of times long gone
Though we knew that we'd be seeing him again

sad to say I must be on my way
So buy me beer and whiskey 'cause I'm going far away (far away)
I'd like to think of me returning when I can
To the greatest little boozer and to Sally MacLennane

The years passed by the times had changed I grew to be a man
I learned to love the virtues of sweet Sally MacLennane
I took the jeers and drank the beers and crawled back home at dawn
And ended up a barman in the morning

I played the pump and took the hump and watered whiskey down
I talked of whores and horses to the men who drank the brown
I heard them say that Jimmy's making money far away
And some people left for heaven without warning

We walked him to the station in the rain
We kissed him as we put him on the train
And we sang him a song of times long gone
Though we knew that we'd be seeing him again

sad to say I must be on my way
So buy me beer and whiskey 'cause I'm going far away (far away)
I'd like to think of me returning when I can
To the greatest little boozer and to Sally MacLennane

When Jimmy came back home, he was surprised that they were gone
He asked me all the details of the train that they went on
Some people they are scared to croak but Jimmy drank until he choked
And he took the road for heaven in the morning

We walked him to the station in the rain
And we kissed him as we put him on the train
And we sang him a song of times long gone
Though we knew that we'd be seeing him again

sad to say I must be on my way
So buy me beer and whiskey 'cause I'm going far away (far away)
I'd like to think of me returning when I can
To the greatest little boozer and to Sally MacLennane

Same as Cash
============================================================
You were still attached to your Civic sedan,
Although the brakes always needed repair
You were headed out to buy some supplies
You could smell the threat of rain in the air
I can only see the scene second-hand
I can only try to understand
How a small amount of pressure in the right place
Breaks the strongest link in the chain
In your car with your head in your hands
At the far end of the Walmart parking lot
Trying not to buckle under the strain

Every single night after prime time
Loud enough to hear in your sleep
The salesman from the lot half a mile from here
Yelling down the hood of his Jeep
I’ll take anything that the others won’t
I can see the value where others don’t
Just a small amount of pressure in the right place
Two fingers to the temporal vein
In your car with your head in your hands
At the far end of the Walmart parking lot
Trying not to buckle under the strain

Striking a bargain with the imp in your brain
Prepared to take another knock for the short gain
But you can ask any veteran running back
Eventually your joints complain

You were headed home at 80 miles an hour
With your fingers sweating under your gloves
Everyone deserves a little light in their hair
Everybody needs to love, and be loved
That’s what all the people say, anyway
I can save my thoughts for another day
Maybe a small amount of pressure in the right place
Anything to help with the pain
In your car with your head in your hands
At the far end of the Walmart parking lot
Trying not to buckle under the strain
============================================================
San Bernardino
============================================================
We got in your car and we hit the highway
Eastern sun was rising over the mountains
Yellow and blood red bits
Like a kaleidoscope

And flaming swords may guard the garden of Eden
But we consulted maps from earlier days
Dead languages on our tongues
Holding on to our last hope

And the day was bright and fine
And the highway sign said, "San Bernardino welcomes you"

I checked us into our hotel and filled the bathtub
And you got in the warm warm water
I pulled petals from my pocket
I loved you so much just then

And it was hard but you were brave, you are splendid
And we will never be alone in this world
No matter what they say
We're gonna be okay

We were safe inside
and our new son cried, "San Bernardino welcomes you"
============================================================
Sarcofago Live

We were hungry, there was no food
We were restless, there were too many things to do
So we gathered in a concrete room
Eyes up at you

And in a small room in Brazil
We were waiting
And in a small room in Brazil
We were waiting

We were howling like dogs
We were feeling the full brunt of the age
Guys from our neighborhood looking down at us
All of you, all of you
Rage, rage, rage

And in a small room in Brazil
We were waiting
And in a small room in Brazil
We were waiting, hey

Satanic Messiah (Song)
============================================================
I saw the posters popping up around the city
Pale blue and washed-out red
I went down to the arena pushing through
Hoping I'd run into you
Sweet freshly-scrubbed smell of the crowd
All the excitement in their eyes
We were all made young when he stepped onto the stage
Like an animal escaping from his cage

Raise the trumpet
Sound the drum
He whom the prophet spoke of long ago has come

All of us too dazed to leave when it was over
Dawdled by the vendors for a minute
Gathered underneath a summer sky
I was hoping you'd pass by
But though I didn't see you that day or the next
I'm pretty sure that you were there
Making your way among the young and happy hoard
Headed down to your reward

Raise the trumpet
Sound the drum
He whom the prophet spoke of long ago has come
============================================================
Satori in Denver
============================================================
Speed down 24 toward the city for supplies
Technically out of bounds
Roll my window down, hear my tires sing to the asphalt
And drink in the highway sounds
Oh solitude, friend of the friendless
Light in the dark night coming on
Grab what I want without saying a word
And drive through the dark 'til dawn

Track lights blur together, anklet buzzing on my leg
Thinking up lies to tell
And this may be the time I get banished from the palace
To seek out some smaller cell
Oh solitude, friend of the friendless
Light in the dark night coming on
Grab what I want without saying a word
And ride through the dark 'til dawn
============================================================
Save the People
============================================================
When wilt thou save the people?
Oh God of mercy when?
The people, Lord, the people
Not thrones and crowns
But men
Flowers of thy heart
O God are they
Let them not pass like weeds away
Their heritage, a sunless day
God save the people

Shall crime bring crime forever
Strength aiding still the strong?
Is it thy will, O Father
That men shall toil for wrong?

No, say thy mountains
No, say thy skies
Man's clouded sun shall brightly rise
And songs be heard
Instead of sighs
God save the people!

When wilt thou save the people?
Oh God of mercy when?
The people, Lord! The people!
Not thrones and crowns but men!

God save the people
For thine they are
Thy children as thy angels fair
Save the people from despair
God save the people!

(Oh God save the people!)
God save the people!
(Oh God save the people!)
God save the people!
(Oh God save the people!)
God save the people!
(Oh God save the people!)

When wilt thou save the people?
Oh God of mercy when!
The people, Lord! The people!
Not thrones and crowns, but men!
God save the people
For thine they are
Thy children as thy angels fair
Save the people from despair
God save the people!

(Oh God save the people!)
God save the people!
(Oh God save the people!)
God save the people!
(Oh God save the people!)
God save the people!
(Oh God save the people!)

Sax Rohmer Number 1
============================================================
Fog lifts from the harbor, dawn goes down to day
An agent crests the shadows of the nearby alleyway
Piles of broken bricks, sign posts on the path
Every moment points towards the aftermath
Yeah ah ah

Sailors straggle back from their nights out on the town
Hopeless urchins from the city gather around
Spies from imperial China wash in with the tide
Every battle heads toward surrender on both sides

And I am coming home to you
With my own blood in my mouth
And I am coming home to you
If it’s the last thing that I do

Bells ring in the tower, wolves howl in the hills
Chalk marks show up on a few high windowsills
And a rabbit gives up somewhere, and a dozen hawks descend
Every moment leads toward its own sad end
Yeah ah ah

Ships loosed from their moorings capsize and then they’re gone
Sailors with no captains watch awhile and then move on
And an agent crests the shadows and I head in her direction
All roads lead toward the same blocked intersection

I am coming home to you
With my own blood in my mouth
And I am coming home to you
If it’s the last thing that I do

Wake up all the birds of prey
Dig your tools out from the clay
Seal the exits of your room
Watch the cactus flowers bloom

And send my regards to the boys down on the corner
Yeah, send my regards to the boys down on the corner

Build a house from sticks and mud
Listen to the poison singing in your blood
Pull yourself a tall cool drink
Carve your initials in the bathroom sink

And send my regards to the boys down on the corner
Yeah, send my regards to the boys down on the corner

The city of Norwalk in my dreams
Rises like Atlantis from a watery grave
Burn the things you have to burn
Save all the people you're supposed to save

And send my belongings to the drop box in Tijuana
And send my regards to the boys down on the corner

Out in the desert in the last light of day
We searched for the footprints of Bobby Beausoleil
And there in the desert past the L.A. county line
Bobby buried the canister in the middle of the night

I'm not alright
I'm not alright
I'm really not up for the fight

Slow it down
Slow it down, down, down
Slow it down
Slow it down, down, down

The gears grind on as the van accelerates
Some things buried deep need to stay that way

I'm not alright
I'm not alright
I'm really not up for the fight

Slow it down
Slow it down, down, down
Slow it down
Slow it down, down, down
Slow it down
Slow it down, down, down

Neither of us said a word
LeAnn Rimes on the car stereo
Sang that song you know I hate
The one about the blackbird
And the rain came down on the windshield
I wished it would wash us both away
You had to open up your mouth, didn't you
I knew what you were gonna say
And you were Barbe bleue's wife
Opening every cupboard, trying to find the smoking gun
And I told you, I told you
I told you not to open that one
============================================================
See America Right
============================================================
I was driving up from Tampa
When the radiator burst
I was three sheets to the wind
A civilian saw me first
And then there was the cop
And then the children standing on the corner
Your love is like a cyclone in a swamp
And the weather's getting warmer

I was getting out of jail
Heading to the Greyhound
You said you'd hop on one yourself
And meet me on the way down
I was shaking way too hard to think
Dead on my feet about to drop
Went and got the case of vodka from a car
And walked the two miles to the bus stop

Got on the bus half drunk again
The driver glared at me
Met up with you in Inglis
Thumbed a ride to Cedar Key
If we never make it back to California
I want you to know I love you
But my love is like a dark cloud full of rain
That's always right there up above you
Hey!
============================================================
Seed Song
============================================================
The rain didn't come for one calendar year
So when the man with the sunflower seeds in his hand came here
We sent him away
We sent him away

The rain didn't come for twelve months more
So when the man with the seed catalogs darkened our door
We sent him away
We sent him away
We sent him away
We sent him away

And I know you're waiting for the ironic ending
And I know you're waiting for the punchline
And I know you're waiting for the rain to come by
So am I
So am I
So am I
So am I
============================================================
Seeing Daylight
============================================================
Two cans clear chicken broth
Two white onions
One bulb garlic

Boil boil
Boil boil

And the screams of delight from the pool outside
The splashing sounds
The coffee heating up on the stove
The sky outside the color of pure fresh milk

Boil boil
Boil boil

And the phone ringing, and me picking it up
And watching myself do so
In the quiet room
In the June evening
And your voice on the other end
And the impossibility of your voice on the other end
And the impossible echo inside

Boil boil
Boil boil
============================================================
Send Me an Angel
============================================================
In an hour or two
The sun will rise on you
And it will be clear what has happened between us

In an hour or two
The wind will come through the window
The wind will tear through the house

I am creeping up the staircase
One step at a time
To bring you roses and chocolate
Roses and chocolate
Roses
Roses
Roses

Sendero Luminoso Verdadero
============================================================
(As they age, men encounter the 6th fear - loss of virility.
Just look him straight in the eye, invade his space by standing a little closer than normal.)
By 8:30 a.m. the sun was so hot that it made me remember
And I pulled on the jacket with the bars on the pocket and I
Stood in front of the window
And the skin on my face has a memory all its own
And it drinks in the pure heat, real slow
I remember Lima, I remember the good life
I remember Lima, I remember the good life

And the window was ten feet high and three feet wide
And sunbeams bounce off the dark water
And come through the clear glass, magnified
Standing here in the house on Pacific Coast Highway
Given to me by a friend whose name is no longer important
My conscience is clean
And the feeling of power like thick red wine
And it's 09:05 military time
I remember Lima, I remember the good life
I remember Lima, I remember the good life
I remember Lima, I remember the good life
I remember Lima, I remember the good life
============================================================
Sentries in the Ambush
============================================================
Not enough air to quite go around
So we seek lower ground
The light plays its tricks on the trees
In forests like these

Losing the thread
Of the path just ahead
Dazzled by the sun
Where's everyone?

I saw notches in the tree trunks
I saw unfamiliar footprints
I heard words of evil omen
Voices in the shadows

Came to a circle of stones
And nothing was left but their bones

Cover them
If you can
Leave a sign
If you can
Send up a flare
If you can
In the dry leaves where the canopy opens

Not enough flesh remaining to say
Who fought bravely today
But I knew them all while they lived
And had fight to give

High in the pines
Searching for signs
Come upon a smoking fire pit
This is it
This is it

Count up our lower numbers
See shapes among the shadows
And now we enter the fray
And nothing can stand in our way

Slaughter them if you can
Kill them all where they stand
Make an example of them
In the dry leaves where the canopy opens
============================================================
Sept. 15 1983
============================================================
Long dinner with some friends
Way out way out in Portmore
Servants of the pharaoh
Slip in through an open door
All business
Bearing knives and zip-guns
So get on the floor now every last one
Every last one

The heat drifts across the land
If I forget Israel
Let me forget my right hand

And on the floor Michael James Williams
Feels his fingers start to freeze
And the whole scene's like a movie
Paramedics on their knees

Try try your whole life
To be righteous and be good
Wind up on your own floor
Choking on blood

The heat drifts across the land
If I forget you Israel
Let me forget my right hand

And the house still smells like onions
When the ambulance arrives
Gabriel in postal blue
Loads up the car and drives to Spanish Town
About three miles away
Where will the wicked run to on that last day?
On that last day?

The heat drifts across the land
If I forget you Israel
Let me forget my right hand
============================================================
Sept 19th Triple X Love! Love!
============================================================
I cut down that withered peach tree
Just like you asked me to
And I hacked it into pieces
Set it on fire with your face in plain view
At the near window where you stood
Watching me split the wood
I will do as I am told
I will keep away the cold

The fire pit in the snow
Gave off a rich bright orange-red glow
A familiar scent rose up into the air
And I remembered something special from a long time ago
You opened up the door
Stepped away from the killing floor
Your footprint on the snow was fresh and new
When you touched me I felt fire come through
I will do as I am told
I will keep away the cold
I will do as I am told
I will keep away the cold
============================================================
Seven Hundred Unspeakable Names
============================================================
I might sail a junk to China
If the wind was right
I might hit up old friends for money
In the middle of the night

I might scale the Chrysler Building
In a lizard suit
I might take up quilting
I might learn to play the flute

But I would not invoke
The seven hundred unspeakable names
No, I would not invoke
Those ancient unspeakable names

I might crash high school reunions
At schools I didn't go to
I might wear a turquoise toe ring
If I could fit my toe through

I might make myself some pancakes
Or I might make a waffle
I might retract my previous couplet
'Cause let's be honest, it was awful

But I would not invoke
The seven hundred unspeakable names
No, I would not invoke
Those ancient unspeakable names

I might take on effulgence and shine
In the black night sky
I might show up in a clown suit
And make all the children cry

...[insert here: the John Hodgman list of names in reverse vocals, see below...

I might blame others for my wretchedness
Or I might look within
I might save a lot of money
If I cut back on the gin

I might seek help for my sickness
Or insist that I'm all right
Or stow away on some mysterious junk
To China in the night

But I would not invoke
The seven hundred unspeakable names
No, I would not invoke
Those ancient unspeakable names
No, no, I would not
Because I could not

[The remaining version of the song is John Hodgman reading almost all of the 700 Unspeakable names in reverse audio. For whatever reason it cuts off 3/4 of the way through at Number 651!

Shadow Song
============================================================
If you get there before me, will you save me a seat?
If you get there before me, would you save me a seat?
But if I never get there at all
Would you leave the seat empty?

If you get there before me, will you light us a fire?
If you get there before me, will you light us a fire?
And if I never show
Will you watch the embers glow?
You can keep the fire burning

This is a song for you
In case I never make it through to where you are
This is a song for you
In case I never make it through to where you are
============================================================
Shaping the Southern Sky
============================================================
I am gonna throw caution to the wind
I'm gonna take a chance again
There was no other way around it
And I won't deny it

We don't take our time
Shaping the southern sky

I am gonna throw caution to the wind
I'm gonna take a chance again
What wasn't a part of the plan
Was written in the sand

We don't take our time
Shaping the southern sky
============================================================
Shave My Eyebrows
============================================================
I'm gonna listen to the [singing of? the powerlines
Until the sun rises in the east
I'm gonna take up my machete
And then I'm gonna tame the beast

I'm gonna sync up with the rhythm
Of the old nodding donkey oil wells
I'm gonna listen to the first two Iron Maiden records
And absolutely nothing else

And I'm gonna shave my eyebrows off for justice
And I'm gonna shave my eyebrows off for luck

Taking back the long hours with the blinds down
Taking my pole axe down from the wall
Almost taking you along in spirit
It was a close call, it was a close call

You must prepare for moments such as this one
You must be steeled against the darker days
You must turn up the volume 'til it can't go any further
Every time Wrathchild plays

And you must know
All your secrets will go with me when I go

And I'm gonna shave two-tenths of a second off my record
And I'm gonna save the children from the burning building

Way down in my grave laughing that you all can't find me
Nobody down here but some crows, thank you very kindly

And I'm gonna shave my eyebrows off for justice, justice
And I'm gonna shave my eyebrows off for luck
============================================================
Shelved
============================================================
I wanna ride the hydraulics
Lit up like the North Star
I wanna wallow in the spoils before the crowd
I wanna play my guitar
Not gonna sit up and beg
Not gonna do tricks
Not gonna stand here on a sound stage
Tethered to a crucifix

The ride's over, I know
But I'm not ready to go

I wanna flash my pastel colors by the rail
On a windy day at Pimlico
Don't want to write songs with this clown they set me up with in a Los Angeles
rehearsal studio
Not gonna tour with Trent Reznor
Third of three, bottom of the bill
You can't pay me to make that kind of music
Not gonna swallow that pill

The ride's over, I know
But I'm not ready to go

Maybe Dad is right
I'm still young
And I can write C++ just as good as anyone
I know this guy at LucasArts
He says they're looking for hands
In fifteen years I'll be puttin' back beers
With my feet in the sand
============================================================
Shield My Eyes Against the Glare
============================================================
Up the hallway and out into the air
Shield my eyes against the glare
Blacktop bubbling in the heat
Satan rising in the street, I don't care much

Wildflowers wither at my touch and I'll burn too
Before I get through

Down the street, step short and sweet
Watch for the hand behind the curtain
There is no trace of it
Not anywhere, so I shield my eyes against the glare
And I slide,
Glide,
Into the intersection

Check out my own reflection
When the gears grind, I won't mind
============================================================
Shirtless in Hamburg
============================================================
Sleep two to a bed
Four to a room
Prophets from the countryside
Glad tidings of doom
Too broke to play around
Like the soldiers do
All up and down
The glittering avenue
Anything's better then the future
I can see that from here

Stack the amplifiers high
Turn up the bass
Spring wild from the wings
With glitter on my young face
It's miserable outside
But in here it's warm
It always feels so stable
At the center of the storm
Snake on my chest for protection
Why the hell not
============================================================
Short Song About the 10 Freeway
============================================================
Evening came on like a big red wing
And the dying sun spilt his colors on everything
And as the night came on, you burst into song
And you scraped your car up against the guardrail
And God is present in the sweeping gesture
But the devil is in the details
============================================================
Short Song for Justin Bieber and His Paparazzi
============================================================
Now on the one hand, it's hard to feel sorry for the very rich
You could record an album of Mountain Goats covers and torpedo your career overnight
You chose this life

But on the other hand, even a rich guy needs some space
And should be able to get to his car without people all up in his face
And gettin' on his case

You don't have to leave Justin alone
You don't have to leave Justin alone
But don't be an asshole

Are there bigger problems in the world, yes
Abortion's legal, but not everybody has access
Try not to be an asshole
Try not to be an asshole
============================================================
Shot, Repeatedly, At Close Range, In the Chest, By Your Love
============================================================
Cross the street
each chance I get
Make sure my shoes get nice and wet
catch a ride
from a landscaping crew
got my fake beard on
they can see right through

Of course they can
A dedicated bounty hunter always gets his man

Shot, repeatedly, at close range, in the chest
by your love, by your love, by your love

Ghost town strip mall,
no cameras in sight
in a bin behind the cell phone store
I settle in for the night
sleep in shifts
beneath the boxes and the trash
three days since I ran
completely out of cash

I won't last long
someday kids by campfires may remember me in song

Shot, repeatedly, at close range, in the chest
by your love, by your love, by your love
============================================================
Shot in the Dark
============================================================
Out on the street I'm stalking the night
I can hear my heavy breathing
Paid for the kill, but it doesn't seem right
Something there I can't believe in
Voices are calling from inside my head
I can hear them, I can hear them
Vanishing memories of things that were said
They can't try to hurt me now

But a shot in the dark
One step away from you
Just a shot in the dark
Always creeping up on you, alright

Taught by the powers that preach over me
I can hear their empty reason
I wouldn't listen, I learned how to fight
I opened up my mind to treason
But just like the wounded, and when it's too late
They'll remember, they'll surrender
Never a care for the people who hate
Underestimate me now

But a shot in the dark
One step away from you
Just a shot in the dark
Always creeping up on you, alright

But just like the wounded, and when it's too late
They'll remember, they'll surrender
Never a care for the people who hate
Underestimate me now

But a shot in the dark
One step away from you
Just a shot in the dark
Always creeping up on you
Just a shot in the dark

Shower
============================================================
The blackest storm I ever saw
Was headed in from Omaha
And the latest news from Tokyo was a lot of ugly numbers
I was checkin' pay phones for forgotten coins
As the clouds formed over West Des Moines
Got into the house, got the curtains drawn
Got into the the shower with all my clothes on
Hey hey, let the water run down
Hey hey, let the water run down

By noon it was clear that winter'd come
And I just let the water run
And I got soap suds in my eyes
And it stung like iodine
The phone started ringing like a fire alarm
And the voice on the machine was brutally calm
New numbers coming down the wire
Got into the shower with my eyes on fire
Hey hey let it fall on me
Let it all come down relentlessly
You swore that you would stick around
When days like this started coming down
Well, get out the crystal
Break out the good champagne
We're going down
In flames
============================================================
Sicilian Crest
============================================================
In these times of wanting prophecy
And false witnesses
Up to all manner of deviltry
Drench a kitchen rag in heretic’s blood
Wash your windows and prepare for the flood

Look to the west
Look to the man
Bearing the Sicilian Crest

Portents in the sky
Say that the time is near
Dial into the signal
Coming in loud and clear
Sacrificial victims out of the cage
Smiling as they're taking the stage

Look to the west
Look to the man
Bearing the Sicilian Crest

Out of the blue
Everything’s new
All the talk we heard was true
The legends we all heard once
The whispers from the storefronts

Hope for the best
Prepare for the worst
We wait like stockpiled landmines
Ready to burst
Wait all your life to see what you see
Open up your eyes and be free

Look to the west
Look to the man
Bearing the Sicilian Crest
============================================================
Sign of the Crow 2
============================================================
These roses are the pleasures of the flesh
These ones here they are the pleasures of the spirit
And tucked behind a pornographic picture in a frame
The troops found the pierced heart and they all gathered near it

And the dust clouds bloomed in the dark
And the face gazed up from the frame
Roomful of French troops in a Franciscan abbey
History does not recall their names

Of the several things that you have to do today
You're gonna regret one
This generation asks for a sign
It isn't gonna get one

Bertha took the pictures to the priest
And the priest fell on his face upon the floor
And the story lived on for a decade or two
But no one really knows it anymore

But the blessed heart is seen in the airbrush
And the blessed heart is beating on the wind
And the bodies of the faithful stacked by dozens by the roadsides
Stripped and scourged and skinned

Of the several things that you have to do today
You're gonna regret one
This generation asks for a sign
It isn't gonna get one

Sinaloan Milk Snake Song
============================================================
(Everybody ready? Uh yeah! Mmhmm.)
Sun melts everything down, and the hills are reduced to nothing
The whole house shakes, and you can see that the coach is coming
You lean down and you pick up the small soft eggs in the dust outside my door
I hold them in my hands, they are warm and the air is warming up now

I've got a message for you, if I could only remember
I've got a message for you, but you're gonna have to come and get it
La la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la

Ever since I came here, all I could think about is water
Last night they brought the fat lamb in from the fold
But I couldn't bring myself to do anything about it
I remember California, I remember Malibu
I remember the states and the names of the cities but I don't remember you

and I've got a message for you, if I could only remember
I've got a message for you, but you're gonna have to come and get it
I've got a message for you, I’ve got a message for you, 2 3 4
La la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la
Yeah!
Whoo
Huh-huh-huh huh huh

Sixteen Tons
============================================================
Some people say a man is made outta mud
A poor man's made outta muscle and blood
Muscle and blood and skin and bones
A mind that's a-weak and a back that's strong

You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine
I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal
And the straw boss said "Well, a-bless my soul"

You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

I was born one mornin', it was drizzlin' rain
Fightin' and trouble are my middle name
I was raised in the canebrake by an ol' mama lion
Cain´t no-a high-toned woman make me walk the line

You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

If you see me comin', better step aside
A lotta men didn't, a lotta men died
One fist of iron, the other of steel
If the right one don´t a-get you, then the left one will

You load sixteen tons, what do you get?
Another day older and deeper in debt
Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
I owe my soul to the company store

Sixty Percent Wolf
============================================================
Among the Douglas Firs so tall and proud
In the shade of the forest with my head bowed
Feeling like the future held something in store
Sinking into the quiet warm forest floor
Gaudeamus igitur
This is what they make you take the medication for
I am sixty percent wolf
Sixty percent wolf
============================================================
Skeleton's Tooth
============================================================
I see the shadows of the prophets in the parapets
Truly they have their reward
Trade you a map of the castle grounds
For some proof that you got past the guards

There’s dried blood on the wrought iron gates
Spies in the tower
I crawled up from the dungeon last night
Under my own power

Spit blood at the sidewalk
Try to stay out of the headlines
Scan the guts of fresh roadkill
Looking for bad signs

Stay safe in the shadows
I know the real truth
Better a mouth full of bloody gums
Than a skeleton’s tooth

I hear the howling of the helpless in the surface noise
Scratch out their names in the dirt
Trade you some tales from a vanished cave
For an invisibility shirt

Recall the proverb of the prodigal son
Not sure who it applies to
Threats of my enemies run loose in my head
The way that lullabies do

Take the road where it leads me
I should probably know better
Just up ahead see the shining sign
Of the debt collector

Sleep and peace attending
All through the night
Skeleton’s tooth gleaming down in the darkness
All fine and bright

Once I walked in splendor
Back in the world of my youth
Better to bury all the better days
Than a skeleton’s tooth
============================================================
Sliding Down the Right Pathway
============================================================
I came sliding down the right pathway
I was shining like a migraine headache
I came calling with my voice newly polished
My throat was reflecting things you had left in the air
And I could taste the air, it was hot in my lungs
It was strange to be in there without you
Light from the window burns my eyes
And that tells me something about you

I sold my soul to the man down the hallway
And I crept lightly into the next room
What was left of your heartbeat burned so brightly
I could feel the light inside, I tightened up inside
When I was in the places you had been in I could hear water
Like I remembered hearing water around you
It came clear in my mind the way the building was set up
And that tells me something about you

The traces you left gave off a weird sequence of lines
And I marked everything in the building with a mark that only I could recognize
And the things in my memory lined up next to each other and they started to burn
And then the smell of your hair came alive within in me, I mean it came alive in me
When I saw you there something inside me changed
And that's the last time I'll ever doubt you
There were animal sounds ringing within the walls
And that tells me something about you
============================================================
Slimy Rich White Bastards
============================================================
you took over alexander hall because you wanted to protest racism.
and you took over alexander all because you thought more of a certain color ought to be hired
you slimy, rich, white bastards
you slimy, rich, white bastards

well your parents sent you out from the east coast
because they were very, very tired of having you proselytize around the house
when you were only sixteen years old
they were willing to spend twenty-one thousand dollars
a year plus whatever other money you needed for gas
and expensive snacks
and meals out
and weekends in TJ
you slimy, rich, white bastards
you slimy, rich, white bastards
you slimy, rich, white bastards

Slip Away from Me
============================================================
Tapped on the window from the inside
Just to hear the glass ring
And it sang out like a shark
Then went silent like a tiny frightened thing

And the small sun fell down through the treetops
And the small sun shattered on the snow
And the snow stretched out like a blanket
Like something I used to know

I let the memory slip away from me
I let my memory slip away from me
And the snow stretched out like a shroud
From our doorstep to the seashore

And the new day, whatever it intends to be
Let my memory be erased irretrievably
The rain will fall on the old house now
A thousand miles away
In the sky sometimes I see a reckoning
When I'm cold and tired
And then the compass tilts like a sinking ship
Or spins like a thing gone wild

Slow West Vultures

Breaking the signal
So it's totally unreadable
Drinking the dregs
Eating the utterly inedible
We do what we do
All for you
All dressed up
Black hat and white cane
Slowly circling the drain
Ready for the future
Ready for the world about to come

Shooting the sequel before the treatment's even finished
Sanding numbers off the monojects
As our slight returns diminish
We are what we are
Get in the goddamn car
Smiling faces flawlessly rehearsed
We are sleek and beautiful
We are cursed
Ready for the future
Ready for the world about to come

Weather cell from northern Canada
Due in before the afternoon is over
Brown cows in the fields
Eating their way slowly through the clover

And the canopy of apple trees before us
Symmetrical and pure as a pagoda
Me and Lee Chong from Chicago in a U-Haul
Headed out through western Minnesota
Headed for the islands
Headed for the islands

Our load is heavy, and you can hear it shifting
Say what you like, I'm never gonna stop
Everyone will eat when we've arrived
White apple blossoms soften up the blacktop

Two days from now we'll get to where we're going
The western sky will pitch correct its whining
Our cargo's gonna spill out from the cabin
And rub its eyes and see the silver lining, yeah yeah
Headed for the islands
Headed for the islands

Snow Crush Killing Song
============================================================
When I ask you to look at me
You look away
I ask you to tell me something nice once
You come at me with all your hot lights on display
I know you're changing
Damn you
I know you're changing
Goddamn you for that

When the snow stacked up outside
You looked around
I could see you from the window
I could see the snow coming down
I know you're changing
Damn you
I know you're changing
Goddamn you
============================================================
Snow Owl
============================================================
You came down from heaven to the branch outside my window
Your feathers were the color of snow
The dice were loaded against us ever seeing each other
But one of us had nowhere else to go

In your eyes were all the colors that the rainbow forgot
Your wingspan was three feet wide or better
With your voice practicing notes from time's own beginning
You took apart the alphabet letter by letter
And here, where it all stops for good
Where the cool waters run
Thought I saw a mouse kicking in your beak
It was only a skeleton
============================================================
Snow Song
============================================================
What cars there are
Go by like snails
And ice crystals shine
On the staircase's handrails
The quiet air
Is worth some discussion
As the windows crack
And the cold is crushing
They've shut down the roads to the coast
And there's white streets as far as the eye can see
And I'd just as soon make you disappear as look at you
But I draw you close to me
How do you feel about that
How do you feel about that
============================================================
So Desperate
============================================================
We were parked in your car
In our neutral meeting place, the Episcopalian churchyard
I had things I’d been meaning to say
but in the dazzling winter sun that late I could feel them melt away

And through the warm radio static
I couldn’t hear my stage directions
And the fog on the windshield
Obscured our sad reflections

I felt so desperate in your arms

We were parked near some trees
And the moonlight soaked the branches in ever-deepening degrees
Had my hand in your hair
Trying to keep my cool ‘til it became too much to bear

When we cracked the windows open
Well the air was just so sweet
We could hear the cars ten feet away
Out there on the street

I felt so desperate in your arms
============================================================
Soft Targets
============================================================
You cry when you get drunk
And I can't find the right things to say
Sooner or later you'll start breaking plates
And I'll do what I can to stay out of your way

There is nobody innocent here
I've got more blood on my hands than you do
It's you and it's me and the baby makes three
Yeah but we've got our love to carry us through
We've got our love to carry us through

I cry when I'm hungry
Something is wrong with my brain
And the ghost of our future's awake in the attic
He moans and he wails as he rattles his chain

We embrace on the floor in the kitchen
Emissaries  from neighboring lands
When I hunt down the vampire that did this to us
I will rip out his heart with my hands
I will rip out his heart with my hands

Solomon Revisited

you say you came to see me,
because you had nothing else to do,
but I've got a radio.
you say you'd thought you'd stop on by
and let me have a look at you,
but I've got a radio.
I've got a radio.
I've got a radio.
I've got a radio.
I've got a radio.

you say you brought some photographs,
but I don't care to see them,
'cause I've got a radio.

you say this place must get dull sometimes,
but that's not the way I see it.
'cause I've got a radio.
I've got a radio.

I've got me a radio.
I've got a radio.

you see these rocks are treacherous,
but how long has it been since you've seen my feet?
you see, I've got a radio.
you warned me about all sorts of things,
but that's not the sort of warning that I need.
you see, I've got a radio.

Some Other Way
============================================================
Test a rope against the ceiling beams
I just want to live on in your dreams
Crush a vial into a pot of tea
I just want you to remember me

But I pour out the pot and I work out the knot
'Cause I know that it won't make you stay
And I'll be damned if I can't come up with some other way
Some other way
Some other way to make you love me

Seal the doors and turn the pilot on
I just know you'll miss me when I'm gone
Drive a fist into a window pane
There are things a letter won't explain

But I pick out the glass and I shut off the gas
And I look to the oncoming day
I'll be damned if I can't come up with some other way
Some other way
Some other way
Some other way to make you love me
To make you love me
To make you love me
To make you love me
To make you love me
============================================================
Some Swedish Trees
============================================================
Well you were standing in the door
While I wondered what you were waiting for
I saw the wild strawberries on the vine
Out of control

While I was trying to think of something clever
You were saying nothing whatsoever
I saw the berries throw their hooks into the soil
Felt the blood between us churning thick as motor oil

We'd come from California
The air around you was familiar to me now
If you were gazing westward
I was looking at you again
Yeah

Somebody Else's Parking Lot in Sebastopol
============================================================
Outside the opera house in Sydney
I saw my life come crashing to its end
And I cried out to the scale-tipper
On whom all living things depend
Sweet strains of Giuseppe Verdi
Suffuse the evening air
I wished, I wished, I wished that God would kill me
Instead of leaving me alone to see you standing there
Before me, that sad look on your face
You took me to so many places I never thought I'd go
That was the worst place

Yeah we did our manners proud
On the night we said goodbye
No big scenes out there on the sidewalk
As we pinpointed the place where all good things go to die
I know you hate it when I get my headaches
Well, I've got a real gem tonight
Listening to Katia Ricciarelli
It's not gonna be alright
And I'd like to think that this will pass, this will pass
I know it's not the case
Of all the highs and lows and middle ends you brought me to
This is the worst place
============================================================
Something Blue
============================================================
You come around here when the lights are down low
And you hang around for six or seven hours and then you get ready to go
Well I remember when you used to kiss me without me asking you to
Yeah I remember when you used to

When I lean toward to you, you turn away
It's a quarter past one A.M. on a warm Saturday
That's alright, that's alright, I hear you
Don't do anything you don't wanna do
But I remember when you used to kiss me without me asking you to
Yeah I remember when you used to
============================================================
Sometimes I Still Feel the Bruise
============================================================
This is just to say hello
And to let you know
I think of you from time to time
I know I never really knew you
But somehow I miss you
And wish that you'd stayed in my life
Making contact gets harder
As the silence grows longer
And isn't it only me
Who'd like us to see each other
How I would hate to be a bother
The way we left it was you'd ring

I'm under no illusion
As to what I meant to you
But you made an impression
And sometimes I still feel the bruise
Sometimes I still feel the bruise

Now and then I'll stumble on
What I've misplaced but never lost
An ache I first felt long ago
Though you've appeared and disappeared
Throughout these past few years
I'd be surprised if you now showed
Making contact gets harder
As the silence grows longer
And why would you think of me
When you were not the one in love
When you were not the dreamer
When you were just the dream

I'm under no illusion
As to what I meant to you
But you made an impression
Sometimes I still feel the bruise
Sometimes I still feel the bruise
============================================================
Sometimes We Mosh
============================================================
Sometimes we mosh, sometimes we stretch, sometimes we dance

sometimes we need some help getting dressed

sometimes we put on our own pants

sometimes we’re at 100%

sometimes we need to rest a little while in the tent,

but sometimes we mosh



my name is Daddy, I mosh with Roman when the day is new

if you come to say hi, we could mosh with you

but maybe it’s naptime, and we’re sound asleep

neither moshing nor dancing, just dreaming of sheep



but when we wake up, it’s on once again

fire up the boombox

turn it all the way up to 10

‘cause sometimes we mosh

sometimes we mosh

sometimes we inside skate, sometimes we outside skate

and sometimes…we mosh

Song for Black Sabbath's Second North American Tour
============================================================
Hang my hammer on a nail
Never see it again
Set sail for the cosmos
High above the world with its beaten-down men

Not long for this world
Have to be reminded
To stay away from windows
Not to leave important things behind

All gone
All gone
With the dawn

And then I'm in an airplane heading west
Over the ocean
Unsteady on my feet again
A body in motion

So far from the slaughterhouse
New creatures with new hearts
Landing at LaGuardia
Tearing up the charts

All gone
All gone
With the dawn
============================================================
Song for Cleomenes
============================================================
Seventy-three years before the advent of the Christian era
As Rome was taking over any land within reach
Setting up proxy governmnents in the conquered lands
There lived one such man given just such a job
Gaius Verres, go

A praetor held a position which operated on trust
He was to govern in the stead of the emperor himself
It was an easy, easy privilege to abuse
And Verres did so

He was the governor of Agrigentum, which we now know as Sicily
And he stole everything that wasn't nailed down
Took improper advantage of other men's wives
The list goes on, trust me
Cicero wrote it all down

At Syracuse, Verres welcomed a band of pirates
They all drank and danced and sang on the shore
And when the husband of one of Verres's paramours came
Bringing a fleet of boats with him
Verres, clever if diabolical, gave him a job
And enlisted the pirates to burn the whole fleet down

The boats burned in the Sicilian harbor
The flames rose hundreds of feet into the air
We stood on the shore, watching them burn
we stood on the shore, we heard the old songs
Hey
============================================================
Song for Dana Plato
============================================================
The three month ride sticks in your mind
As though the insides of your head were a big screen
And coming in on the evening wind
It's the unmistakable scent of Brilliantine
What kind of memory serves, what kind of world is it that
Comes headlong at you and then swerves at the last possible second
It's this one
Yeah, it's this one

And it's easy to slow down
And it's easy to slow down
And it's easy just to lie out by the blue pools
In the squinting sun and slow down
And it's easy to slow down

And in situations like these
It's sometimes useful to think of life as one long continuous evening
That never turns into night
Hey hey
============================================================
Song for Dennis Brown
============================================================
On the day that Dennis Brown's lung collapsed
Spring rain was misting down on Kingston
And down at the harbor
Local cops were intercepting an inbound shipment
And for a while there it was chaos
As they handcuffed and then roughed up some sailors
On the day my lung collapses
It's not gonna be much different

On the day that Dennis Brown's habits caught up with him
Schoolchildren sang in choirs
And out behind the Chinese restaurants
Guys were jumping into dumpsters
And the stench was overbearing
But they were past the point of caring
On the day my habits catch up with me
I'll be down among the jumpers

And when the birds come home in spring
We will fill them full of buckshot
And jets of contaminated blood
Will cloud the rivers and the lakes
It took all the coke in town
To bring down Dennis Brown
On the day my lung collapses
We'll see just how much it takes
============================================================
Song for God
============================================================
Neighbor kids running across the front yard this evening
Sun going down, wind gathering strength
The state I live in is the largest of its kind
It takes two days or better to walk across its length

If you try to come and find me, I will know you're coming
There's an old fallout shelter I can hide in
I won't even be able to hear their hoofbeats
When the horsemen ride in

Another mild winter, time seems to stand still
Sky swallows up the city like a tent
Young breezes' razor patterns in the dust
No way of saying what they're supposed to represent

I have come to where I've come to now
Always abiding in you
If you try to find me now I'll be invisible to everything when
The horsemen come riding on through

Song for Greg Valentine
============================================================
When they get me in a corner, break legs
When I feel alone and useless, break legs
If I can't claim the victory
I'm taking you down with me
Break legs, break legs, break legs

When your enemies are closing in, break legs
When they've got you under contract, break legs
When they're filling out your card
Go hard
Break legs, break legs, break legs

Tear my insides up
With over the counter stuff
Jump the turnbuckle and grimace
Try to look tough

When you get a reputation, break legs
Brook no insubordination, break legs
When the beer cups are raining down on you
Do what they're paying you to do
Break legs, break legs
Break legs, break legs, break legs
Break legs, break legs, break legs
============================================================
Song for John Davis
============================================================
The day we set sail from England
The wind behind us was fair
The day we set sail from England
There were smiling faces everywhere
And the snow came down on New Hampshire today
And the snow came down on New Hampshire today

The day we put the grain into the ground
There were smiling faces all around
And underneath the trees we'd planted when we landed
And when I was a child
I spoke with the language of a child
But when I became a man, I put away childish things
And the snow came down on New Hampshire today
And the snow came down on New Hampshire today
============================================================
Song for Lonely Giants
============================================================
No one washed behind my ears
High in the trees alone for years
Practicing my solitary scales 'til they rose like balloons
Watching them go where they will go

Face in the leaves
Song in my throat
Fall through the air
Hoping to float

Practicing my solitary scales 'til they grow heavy
Too heavy to carry
Watching them go where they will go
============================================================
Song for Mark and Joel
============================================================
I opened up the window and the cold air came in
And I saw a bird on a branch outside
That I had never seen before
He looked a robin, but it had an upside down v-shaped
Red mark on its chest
And I had a special feeling in my mind
I had a special feeling in my mind
I had a certain glint in my eye
On the morning the trouble came by

There was a map of the American Midwest on one wall
And there was a map of the American West on another wall
And there was a map of Rome on the third wall
And there were maps in all directions
I was looking at them, pondering connections
When trouble came by

Then I stuck my head out the window
I had to stick my head out the window
It was much colder than I'd imagined it would be
It was much, much colder than I'd imagined it would be
It was much, much colder
It was much, much colder and trouble came by
============================================================
Song for Mitch Williams
============================================================
you came to california.
you left houston by night.
and you looked around anaheim, there was nothing there.
and your fastball has been clocked at better than a hundred miles an hour.
even so, yesterday they let you go.

on the plane home you get them to give you a seat alone,
and when the stewardess comes by
you feel the fire flashing on your eyes
because just between the badge and the belt you can see the strike zone.
yeah, just between the badge and the belt you can see the strike zone.
but you gotta stop thinking that way.
it's ten fifteen on a tuesday morning
and the sky through the cabin window is bright and powder blue.
============================================================
Song for My Sons
============================================================
This is a song for my sons for when they understand it
You know how life is full you know we couldn't plan it
your dad and I prayed for strength and understanding
for things we couldn't see or comprehend

This is a song for you, to carry in your pocket
take all our love with you in all the paths you walk in
I can't say your life will always go like it should
but I can say that God is always good

and when the cold wind blows like I know it will
and when you feel alone like I know you will
and when the cold wind blows like we know it will

Don't let your love grow
Don't let your love grow
Don't let your love grow cold

This is a song for my sons for when they understand it
You know how life is full you know we couldn't plan it
your dad and I prayed for strength and understanding
for things we couldn't see or comprehend

This is a song from my heart a small refrain to hold you
for times when we're apart and I cannot console you
Be honest with yourself and don't forget to pray
and read your bible everyday

and when the cold wind blows like I know it will
and when you feel alone like I know you will
and when the cold wind blows like I know it will

Don't let your love grow
Don't let your love grow
Don't let your love grow cold
============================================================
Song for My Stepfather
============================================================
You have got that look in your eyes
In the pinprick place where kindness goes to die
I'll be six years old next year
You erase me

You'll be sorry, you always feel sorry later on
When you come around to say so, I will be gone
And in my place, meet my letter-perfect body double
You erase me

And a few years later, I set out on my own
Learned to take the reins up all by myself
Dug the spurs in clean down to the bone

But all that comes later
Now there's only you and me
And the replica where my body used to be
You can go ahead and hit him
He feels no pain at all
You erase me
You erase me
============================================================
Song for Roger Maris
============================================================
When the power of God shows up in your swing
And the people start to notice and you can't do anything about it
And they all come out to see you
And they start to crowd around
Let me tell you brother, you can feel it coming down
And I got an angel watching over me
A monkey on my back
The devil at my heels
Reporters breathing down my neck

Yeah, my father always told me to finish what you start
My wife's about to leave me and it's going to break my heart
And I no longer have my youth
I no longer have my looks
I got a goddamn one-way ticket to the goddamn history books
And I got an angel watching over me
A monkey on my back
The devil at my heels
Reporters breathing down my neck
============================================================
Song for Sasha Banks
============================================================
We don't get cable in Belle Plaine
But on Thursday night there's matches on TV
Get kicked out of the living room for watching
My brother and me
My brother and me

Keep watching with the lights out back in his room
Chris Jericho starts tearing up the set
I want to do right by my brother
I want to do right by this feeling in my gut

Everybody's got their own spot
Find mine
In sixty-four-point type atop the top line
Up on the top line

Head off to camp in Boston
Come up through the independents
Those who would stand between me and my final destination
Get torched inside the fire of my transcendence

California, Minnesota, Massachusetts
They can tell I'm coming up by the expression on my face
I'm gonna make a lot of money
Everyone I love is gonna have their own safe place

Everybody's got their own spot
Find mine
In sixty-four-point type atop the top line
Up on the top line
============================================================
Song for Ted Sallis
============================================================
Into the source of the squall
I inevitably fall
Toward the wellspring of all agony
Shuffling endlessly
Whether or not it was always going to be this way
It only mattered yesterday

No skin like the skin you woke up in
No skin like the skin you woke up in

Up from the earth and the clay
Melting away
Never lose enough to find my form
Trudge through the storm
Wait in hope
For some as yet undiscovered isotope

No skin like the skin you woke up in
No skin like the skin you woke up in

When at last
The die gets cast
Read the numbers out loud
With your head bowed

Try to find a face to focus on
But the memory's gone
Wherever my former self went
It was an accident
Try to picture him in my mind's eye
Say goodbye

No skin like the skin you woke up in
No skin like the skin you woke up in
============================================================
Song for Tura Satana
============================================================
Doll squad's at the drive-in
It's 1973
The fruit is full and fat this year on the orange trees
Which grow in clusters
The city sixty miles away
As the sunset tries desperately to break through the gray
And the stardust came down, royal blue
As the San Bernardino sky showered over you

Coming home early is always a mistake
But when you see that woman on the sofa something in you breaks
You've got a celluloid tendency to flare out and blaze
And the report sounds once like a failed hymn of praise
And the stardust came down, royal blue
As the San Bernardino sky showered over you
============================================================
Song for an Old Friend
============================================================
A garter snake passed lazily through the tall yellow-headed sourgrass
there was cold, clear water in a tall, clean glass
the sunlight hit the sides and it came through the water tilted
I saw the condensation on your hand
I could feel the glaciers melting

And a warm, soft wind
Covered up everything
On the day your love came screaming through me

You had oranges and lemons in a canvas bag beside you
And seven different kinds of light welling up inside of you
You smeared citrus pulp all over me - it felt okay
Good old East Rutherford three thousand miles away

I felt the warm surge blast my mind
Coming in from behind
On the day your love came screaming through me

In the fresh light of day
I felt something falling away
On the day your love came screaming through me
============================================================
Song for the Julian Calendar
============================================================
Sun twinkling on the river this evening
I tasted chocolate on my tongue
Darkness climbing up the ladders to the sky
Rung by agonizing rung
I heard firecrackers popping next door
Wondered what it was I'd bargained for
When I lay quiet on the floor and you were knocking

Let me be your witness
Let me walk out on the edge
The sun refused to shine on my backyard today
Darkness climbing up the house
Coming through the window ledge
I heard the firecrackers bursting on the sidewalk
Heard you talking your baby talk
Saw the bright lights again and I
Felt the shock when you were knocking
============================================================
Song from the Shoreline
============================================================
Through the bodies of a hundred people, I saw you
Saw you coming through the crush
Saw you pushing through

And in the bodies of a hundred people moving around
I shut my ears off to the world
I couldn't hear a sound
In the bodies of a hundred people, I saw you
I saw you coming through the crush
I saw you pushing through
============================================================
Source Decay
============================================================
Once a week
I make the drive
two hours east
to check the Austin post office box
And I take the detour
through our old neighborhood
See all the Chevy Impalas
in their front yards up on blocks
And I park in an alley
And I read through the postcards you continue to send
Where as indirectly as you can
You ask what I remember
I like these torture devices from my old best friend
Well, I'll tell you what I know
like I swore I always would
I don't think it's gonna do you any good

I remember the train headed south out of Bangkok
Down toward the water

I always get a late start
when the sun's going down
and the traffic's thinning out
and the glare is hard to take
I wish the west Texas highway was a Möbius strip
I could ride it out forever
when I feel my heart break
I almost swear I hear it happen
It's that clear and that hard
I come in off the highway and I park in my front yard
I fall out of the car
like a hostage from a plane
Think of you a while
Start wishing it would rain

And I remember the train headed south out of Bangkok
Down toward the water

I come in to the house
Put on a pot of coffee
Walk the floors a little while
I set your postcard on the table
with all the others like it
I start sorting through the pile
I check the pictures
and the postmarks
and the captions
and the stamps
for signs of any pattern at all
When I come up empty-handed
the feeling almost overwhelms me
I let a few of my defenses fall
And I smile a bitter smile
It's not a pretty thing to see
I think about a railroad platform back in 1983

And I remember the train headed south out of Bangkok
Down, down toward the water
============================================================
Sourdoire Valley Song
============================================================
Bang the small rocks on the big ones
Til the small ones are sharp and clean
Catch something, kill something
New blade cuts real keen

And then the grass grows up to cover up
The firepit and the forge
Half a world away from the Olduvai Gorge

Chew these roots for a toothache
Chew these ones for atmosphere
Dream the pleasant dreams
that people dream
When they grow up down here

And then the grass grows up to cover up
The firepit and the forge
Half a world away from the Olduvai Gorge

Take care of the old man
See if he's in pain
Have somebody stay with him
Comfort him when he complains

Keep to ourselves mostly
Few friends and fewer closer friends
Lead a long life if you're lucky
Hope it never ends

And then the grass grows up to cover up
The firepit and the forge
Half a world away from the Olduvai Gorge
============================================================
Southwestern Territory
============================================================
Small screen, July evening view
Up and down Grand Avenue
Where the legends get made
Out with the boys' brigade
Part of the motorcade
Flew home from Texas last night
Slept on the flight
Work like a dog all day
Born to chase cars away
Die on the road someday
I try to remember what life was like long ago
But it's gone, you know
Climb the turnbuckle high
Take two falls out of three
Blackout for local TV

Stand in that cold empty hall
Wait for your name to get called
Burn like hillsides on fire
In the squall of the ringside choir
High as a wire
Nearly drive Danny's nose back into his brain
All the cheap seats go insane
Keep my eyes open and try to think straight
No one drives on the 60 this late
Feel like the last person alive
Francisquito to Glenshaw Drive
I try to remember to write in the diary
That my son gave me
Climb the turnbuckle high
Take two falls out of three
Blackout for local TV
============================================================
Southwood Plantation Road
============================================================
I've got you
You've got whatever's left of me to get
Our conversations are like minefields
No one's found a safe way through one yet
I spend a lot of money
I buy you white gold
We raise up a little roof
Against the cold
On Southwood Plantation Road
Where at night the stars blow like milk across the sky
Where the high wires drop
Where the fat crows fly

All night long you giggle and scream
Your brown eyes deeper than a dream
I am not going to lose you
We are going to stay married
In this house like a Louisiana graveyard
Where nothing stays buried
On Southwood Plantation Road
Where the dead will walk again
Put on their Sunday best
And mingle with unsuspecting Christian men
La la la la la
============================================================
Spellbound
============================================================
From the cradle bars comes a beckoning voice
You're sent spinning, you have no choice
You hear laughter cracking through the walls
You're sent spinning, you have no choice

Following the footsteps of a rag doll dance
We are entranced
Spellbound

Following the footsteps of a rag doll dance
We are entranced
Spellbound
Spellbound, spellbound, oh

And don't forget when your elders forget
To say their prayers
Take them by the legs
And throw them down stairs

When you think your toys have gone berserk
It's an illusion you cannot shirk
You hear laughter cracking through the walls
You're sent spinning, you have no choice

Following the footsteps of a rag doll dance
We are entranced
Spellbound

Following the footsteps of a rag doll dance
We are entranced
Spellbound
Spellbound, spellbound, oh
============================================================
Spent Gladiator 2
============================================================
Like a spent gladiator
Crawling in the Colosseum dust
Who can count on his remaining limbs
All the people he can trust
Like the one who stands behind him
Cheering him on
Ecstatic when he stands defiant
Wild with abandon when he's gone

Just stay alive
Keep your eyes on the pay line

Like a village on the steppe
About to get collectivized
When the men emerge with rifles from the haystack
Everybody looks surprised
Like the mice in the forgotten grain
Way up on the top shelf
Like someone who's found a small town to escape to
Keeps one eye on his abandoned former self

Stay in the game
Just try to play through the pain
Like a fighter who's been told it's finally time for him to quit
Show up in shining colors
And then stand there and get hit

Like the clock that ticks in Dresden
When the whole town's been destroyed
Like the nagging flash of insight
You're always desperate to avoid
Like the bloody-knuckled gunman
Still stationed at the breach
Like that board game with the sliders
And the children on the beach

Stay alive
Maybe spit some blood at the camera
Just stay alive
Stay forever alive
============================================================
Spilling Toward Alpha
============================================================
I hear you moving in the hallway
I hear you sharpening your claws
I hear you polishing your teeth sometimes
But I don't mind

And I hear you out in the garage
I hear you messing with the motor
I hear you tinker with the engine sometimes
But I don't mind

And I hear you moving in the kitchen
I hear you in there late at night
I notice when you leave the gas jets on sometimes
But I don't mind
============================================================
St. Stephen
============================================================
Saint Stephen with a rose
In and out of the garden he goes
Country garden in the wind and the rain
Wherever he goes the people all complain

Stephen prospered in his time
Well he may and he may decline
Did it matter, does it now?
Stephen would answer if he only knew how

Wishing well with a golden bell
Bucket hanging clear to hell
Hell halfway twixt now and then
Stephen fill it up and lower down and lower down again

Lady finger, dipped in moonlight
Writing "What for" across the morning sky
Sunlight scatters, dawn with answers
Darkness shrugs and bids the day goodbye

Speeding arrow, sharp and narrow
What a lot of fleeting matters you have spurned
Several seasons with their treasons
Wrap the babe in scarlet colors, call it your own

Did he doubt or does he try
Answers aplenty in the by and by
Talk about your penny, talk about your ills
One man gathers what another man spills

Saint Stephen will remain, all he's lost he has regained
Seashore washed by the suds and foam
Been here so long, he's got to calling it home

Fortune comes a callin', Daddy and Roman
Singin' that curious sense of their own
Can you answer, yes I can
But what would be the answer to the answer man
============================================================
Stabbed to Death Outside San Juan
============================================================
The winter's wet, and the summer's hot
Take a match in Puerto Rico, why not
Power and adrenaline flowing like amber
From the recesses of the earth, put on your waders
And twitch when the water runs high sometimes
Twitch when the tide ebbs low

See the sights, maybe go downtown
Sometimes you get some heat, sometimes it follows you around
When the blade hits the bone, everybody hears it sing
Shower room full of people, no one hears a goddamned thing
A twitch when the current runs wild sometimes
Twitch when the contact howls

All that racket out there in the arena
I’m on a stretcher, here come the cleaners
And the sky goes dark and there I am
Climbing down the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram
I drop from the top of my tall steel cage
Drop to the concrete floor
============================================================
Stable Boy Song
============================================================
Here come the times of changing tide
Here come the days of light and grace
Here come the hours of wordless wondrousness
Light, light will fill this humble place

When you come the stars will shine brighter than spun gold
When you come the world will seem shiny and new
My mom told me that someday someone like you would come to set things right
'Til you come I'll keep this place ready for you

I saw them riding up the road
And I swept and scrubbed the stable twice
Filled it with golden yellow straw, sweet and clean
I did my best to make things nice

When you come the stars will shine brighter than spun gold
When you come the world will seem shiny and new
My mom told me that someday someone like you would come to set things right
Until you come I'll keep this place ready for you
============================================================
Stack Em Up
============================================================
Louder than your Windsor V8, dusty tennis shoes
Ten years since I’d seen you, on the day I heard the news
No one riding shotgun for seven years at least
Short of breath and bitter on the 60 headed east

Stack em up
Like unanswered letters
Stack em up
You got sick and you never got better

Six foot two and flawless, still some baby fat
Two of us, one year later, here we are, imagine that
Dan went to prison, he shot someone you said
Your beautiful blonde ringlets stacked up around your head

Stack em up
Try to understand it
Stack em up
Too pretty for this planet

Some you lose track of
Some you have to bury
Some dash back toward the darkness they emerged from
Some you have to carry

In dreams your face is radiant, in dreams your laugh is loud
In dreams I see you standing right before me young and proud
What was it like for you when your moment arrived
I knew you before the amber got you, when you were alive

Stack em up
Keep your candle burning bright
Stack em up
To sleep in your shadow every night
============================================================
Standard Bitter Love Song Number 1
============================================================
I'm not going to say what I came over to say to you
But you were thinking along the same lines
And you let the words come ringing through

I wouldn't've said that to you
I wouldn't say it if they paid me to
You got no manners
You got no manners at all
You got no manners

You got no manners
You got no manners at all
You got no manners

I'm going to try real hard
But I, I can't believe that you're really gonna do it
It's like one of those Chinese kites flying in the wind
And then some kid with a shotgun sends a bullet through it

And I, I came here to say it
But I've done that before
But would never have told you that I don't love you anymore
You got no manners
You got no manners at all
You got no manners

You got no manners
You got no manners at all
You got no manners
============================================================
Standard Bitter Love Song Number 4
============================================================
Well I see you've left me a photograph
Of a leopard tearing an antelope in half
What have you done
What have you done
What have you done
With our love
What have you done

Well I see you've resorted to petty theft
You want to take something from me
But there's nothing left
What have you done
What have you done
What have you done
With our love
Where have you put it

Well I hear you calling from way over there
And I can't find it anywhere
What have you done
what have you done
What have you done
With our love
What have you done
============================================================
Standard Bitter Love Song Number 5
============================================================
Come down in the flatland
Show me your shoulder
Wait now where the black hand touches us
We'll both grow older

And the sky above us
And the ground beneath us
And the air around us
And the ocean to the right

Measure your arm length
I can't live without it
I treasure those thirty inches
I want to talk about it.

And the sky above us
And the ground beneath us
And the air around us
And the ocean to the right

Love you in the cold air
Your long hair makes me shiver
Above you I see the sun
Light up every sliver

And the sky above us
And the ground beneath us
And the air around us
And the ocean to the right

And the sky above us
And the ground beneath us
And the air around us
And the ocean to the right
============================================================
Standard Bitter Love Song Number 6
============================================================
I don't like what I've turned into
There's a hole in my chest in the spot that you wormed out through
They say it's on the mend,
But it hurts me when I bend, yeah.

And I saw you down at Angie's place
That rippling smile on your perfect face
Well it really doesn't suit you.
When I see it I want to shoot you, sorry.

And I don't like what you said to me.
I don't like what you said to me.
But i guess I'll have to deal with it
Let the bullet hit me and I just reel with it,
Isn't that right?
Isn't that right?
Isn't that right?
Isn't that right?
============================================================
Standard Bitter Love Song Number 7
============================================================
You smile at me in total defiance of all decency
You've got it down to a science, that innocent look
You've got it practiced real good
But I know you'd kill me if you could stand the sight of blood

If I'd been a fly on the wall a little earlier
If I'd been one of the innumerable flies in this room
If I'd been a fly on the wall a little earlier
It would've been real different around here

You try to speak but the buzzing's too loud
And it's hard to make you out through the dense black cloud
That surrounds us both, that's just as well
You call them up, let the whole house go to hell

If I'd been one of these flies
I would've lodged myself firmly underneath your eyelid
If I'd been one of these flies a little earlier
It would've been real different around here
============================================================
Standard Bitter Love Song Number 8
============================================================
I went down to Lloyd Center looking for you
But a mouth full of anger blocked my view
He took your hand there in the skating rink
God will give him blood to drink

Saw the two of you leaving
I didn't wanna follow behind
But I could see the rest of your evening burning in my mind
The sky's black, the moon's pink
God will give him blood to drink

I looked over the railing, the ice was white
On the northeast side where I saw you and your boyfriend
On a Friday night
I went mining for gold, I struck pure, fresh zinc
God, God will give him blood to drink
Hey hey hey
============================================================
Star Dusting
============================================================
Toward the end of our first year in Las Vegas
You looked up from your little corner
And I saw that your face was getting a little brighter
And you asked me is it really getting warmer
Or is it just me
And then you started mumbling
Unintelligibly
So what are you saying anyway

I thought I heard bells ringing
But then I remembered that I no longer knew what bells sounded like
I thought we'd maybe strike up a conversation
'Til bad luck cruised by on his ten-speed bike
I got real cold
And I grabbed my coat
And I saw that the ringing was coming from your throat
What are you saying anyway
============================================================
Stars Around Her
============================================================
I saw the darkness coming down
It posed no threat to me
I let the darkness ease its way around
It was every good thing I'd expected it would be
I saw you coming
Through the twisting vines outside
I saw the new moon collide
With the stars clustered around her

I saw the young fruit on the new lime
I felt your breath catch its rhythm
I heard your legs push away the tall dry brush
I saw the moon and the stars
And knew the secrets within them
I heard you saying my name into my ear
No one has to tell me why you've come here
'Cause I know
I know
I know
============================================================
Stars Fell on Alabama
============================================================
You looked real calm as we made our way up the walk
There were lazy kisses, and hands brushing and small talk
The moon was high, your smooth face was dry
And the kudzu grew

And the stars fell on Alabama
And your eyes filled up with light
And the stars fell on Alabama

The warm earth underneath us gave way
Dry grass crinkled like paper as a breeze came in across the bay
Cold clean water nearby glimmered in your eyes
And your pistol glistened

And the stars fell on Alabama
And your eyes filled up with light
And the stars fell on Alabama
But if you think I'll take a bullet for you, you're dreaming
============================================================
Steal Smoked Fish
============================================================
Across the Burnside bridge before
Anyone shot their movies there
We hid from the whipping rain
When we had run out of cocaine
Dispatch down to Plaid Pantry
Two on point, and two on sentry
Ah, the joys that the lesser days bring
Make you throw back your heads and sing

God bless all petty thieves
With tins of oysters up their sleeves
Feast when you can
And dream when there's nothing to feast on

Across a different bridge today
Over the river and down Broadway
Feels so good to have you here
Some of you will be dead next year
I see your destinies above you
Like angels who don't love you
Let them kiss you and hold you tight
As long as the money's right

God bless all my old friends
And god bless me too, why pretend?
Feast when you can
And dream when there's nothing to feast on

God bless the guys from my old neighborhood
Gone past the point where any blessings can do them any good

Attach the C-4 where you must
Disappear in a cloud of dust
But spare a thought for what it covers up
Pour a triple and raise your cup
We were here once, me and my friends
But we destroyed all of the evidence
And vanished into the night
At least we got that one right

God bless us, all of us
We who learn to shun the light
God bless all vampires every night
Feast when you can
Feast when you can
Feast when you can
Feast when you can
============================================================
Stench of the Unburied
============================================================
Incoherent but functional
Speeding like a dead comet
Purple crushed-velvet waistcoat
Flecked with Maalox and bits of dried vomit
Say what you will for the effort
You can't fault the technique
Still conscious at sunrise
For the third time this week
But when the blue lights flash
I know we're going to crash

And outside it's 92 degrees
And KROQ is playing Siouxsie and the Banshees

Blaupunkt in the dashboard
Cracks in the cylinder block
Heading up the Golden State Freeway
Toward Eagle Rock
Ice chest full of Corona
And Pineapple Crush
It'll take 20 years
For the toxins to flush
And when the sirens wail
I know we're going to jail

And outside it's 92 degrees
And KROQ is playing Siouxsie and the Banshees

Follow the flame to freedom
The flickering lights of armageddon
Find the foot of the ladder way down in the pit
Keep climbing forever
Try to keep the torch lit

And outside it's 92 degrees
And KROQ, the Rock of the 80s, is playing Siouxsie and the Banshees

Store
============================================================
In the five minutes' worth of lost time that I had
When I was passed out on the supermarket floor
I saw you at the head of the heavenly chorus
And I heard your song ringing all through the store

In the five minutes when my broadcast got pre-empted
I saw you touch down, you were no longer dead
I was happy to see you, I had lots of questions
And I put my hand to the wound in your head
Ah, the blood
All of that blood
All of that warm blood
Flowing freely from you

In the five minutes when I was dead to the world
In a place far away from my friends and my home
I saw you with a smile on your radiant face
Amidst all of the cans and the glass and the chrome

And in those five minutes, my signal was jammed
The frequencies that I received were so pure
That I almost believed that the sight of the hole in your skull
Was a thing that my heart could endure
Ah, the blood
All of that blood
All of that warm blood
Flowing freely from you
============================================================
Straight Six
============================================================
Dull powder blue paint job, Earl Scheib special
Dashboard full of talismans to try and push fate
Rabbit skull hanging from the rear-view
Six kicking cylinders lined up straight
And I ride
And I glide down the streets of this city
All night, uptight
Jenny's on the cellular, high as a kite

There's a crack in the windshield eighteen inches long
Evaporating snow forming crystals on the chrome
Brand new battery I shoplifted from the Pep Boys
Cold cranking power to bring me on home
And I ride
And I glide down the streets of this city
All night, uptight
Jenny's on the cellular, high as a kite
Sometimes the moon shines like a beacon to the weary and the sick in spirit
And sometimes, sometimes it's dark
============================================================
Stuck in Time
============================================================
Standing silent when I see
Icicles hanging from the trees
Loon calling on the evening wind
Something new in mind, new in mind

Stillness enveloping this town
Bulbs opening underground
And I saw a young dog on its way
Down the street today

We grow nameless as we feel the blood race
Henceforth through our bodies
On its mission to no place

What am I becoming when I see
The way you look at me
One frozen river
Stuck in time
============================================================
Sudden Oak Death
============================================================
Lose a little feeling in my fingers
Gain an edge of panic in my face
Search for some sign to tell me just how long I've been here
Overturn the place

Feels like each time my efforts fail
The whole hillsides disapprove
Feel like a man whose veins have frozen overnight
Lying there trying to move

Yeah when the crack sounds in the wood
You will know that I'm down for good
When the crack sounds in the wood
You will know, old friend, that I'm down for good

I wanna try to stand my ground
Dig my heels into the hills
Hope someone will come to right my balance
No one will

Feels like when I try to stretch my legs
Everyone around me's trying too
So ready just to fall down, just to fall down
And to stay down
I don't wanna spoil the view

Yeah when the crack sounds in the wood
You will know that I'm down for good
When the crack sounds in the wood
You will know, old friend, that I'm down for good

Suedehead

Why do you come here
And why, why do you hang around
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry

Why do you come here
When you know it makes things hard for me
When you know, oh
Why do you come

Why do you telephone
And why, why send me silly notes
I'm so sorry
I'm so sorry

Why do you come here
When you know it makes things hard for me
When you know, oh
Why do you come

You had to break into my room
Just to read my diary
It was just to see, just to see
All the things you knew I'd written about you
Oh, so many illustrations
Oh, but
I'm so sickened
I am so sickened now

It was a good lay, good lay
It was a good lay, good lay
It was a good lay, good lay, good lay, oh

Sugar, We're Going Down
============================================================
Am I more than you bargained for yet?
I've been dying to tell you anything you want to hear
Cause that's just who I am this week
Lie in the grass next to the mausoleum
I’m just a notch in your bedpost
But you're just a line in a song

Drop a heart, take a name
We’re always sleeping in, sleeping for the wrong team

We’re going down, down in an earlier round
And Sugar, we’re going down swinging
I’ll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

We’re going down, down in an earlier round
And Sugar, we're going down swinging
I’ll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

Is this more than you bargained for yet?
Oh, don't mind me, I'm watching you two from the closet
Wishing to be the friction in your jeans
Isn’t it messed up how I’m just dying to be him?
I’m just a notch in your bedpost
But you're just a line in a song

Drop a heart, break a name
We’re always sleeping in, sleeping for the wrong team

We’re going down, down in an earlier round
And Sugar, we’re going down swinging
I’ll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

We’re going down, down in an earlier round
And Sugar, we’re going down swinging
I’ll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

We're going down, down in an earlier round
And Sugar, we’re going down swinging
I’ll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

We’re going down, down in an earlier round
And Sugar, we’re going down swinging
I’ll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it

Summer
============================================================
Ridin' 'round town with all the windows down
Eight track playin' all your favorite sounds
The rhythm of the bongos fill the park
The street musicians tryin' to get a start

'Cause it's summer
Summer time is here
Yes, it's summer
My time of year
Yes, it's summer
My time of year

Stretched out on a blanket in the sand
Kids of all ages diggin' Disneyland
Rappin' on the CB radio in your van
We’ll all give a big "ten four" to the truckin' man

'Cause it's summer
Summer time is here
Yes, it's summer
My time of year

In Atlantic City or out in Malibu
Or anywhere between, I'm telling you
When you feel those balmy breezes on your face
Summer time is the best time any place

Cause it's summer
Summer time is here
Yes, it's summer
My time of year

Cause it's summer
Summer time is here
Yes, it's summer
My time of year
My time of year

Sun Song
============================================================
The sun was a yellow eye in a blue face
When you came over to my place
And you said how things looked dead around here
Well that's alright if things look dead around here
'Cause it's only a little while longer that things are gonna look dead around here

And there are certain gardening skills that you don't have yet
And there are certain gardening skills that you'll never learn
How to leave alone what's doing fine
How to mulch what's dying on the vine
There are certain gardening secrets you don't know

You said the soil looked nitrogen poor
Well, don't you worry about the soil looking nitrogen poor
I think that's my problem if the soil is nitrogen poor
But for myself it looks kind of nitrogen rich

And there are certain gardening secrets you don't have yet
And there are certain gardening skills that you'll never learn
How to leave alone what's doing fine
How to mulch what's dying on the vine
There are certain gardening secrets you don't know

Supergenesis
============================================================
In the twinkling of an eye, my sentence gets passed
And I drop to the ground and I go slithering through the grass
Carving out battle lines as I crawl

Find a hollow branch to rest in, slip inside
Wait for mice to poke their heads in, jaw hinged open wide
Hang by my tail, listening for the call

'Cause someday, someday the call will sound
And we all, we all are gonna get up from the ground

Feel the wet leaves pressed against me, cling like drowning men
Try to hoist myself upright, again, try again
Hold on to the memories all night

And where my legs and arms once sprouted, skin is smooth and slick
Rub the smooth spots on some rough rocks, I feel cold and sick
Hold on to the battle plan, hold tight

'Cause someday, someday, the call will sound
And we all, we all are gonna get up from the ground
============================================================
Superheroes
============================================================
I've done a lot, God knows I've tried
To find the truth, I've even lied
But all I know is down inside I'm bleeding

And superheroes come to feast
To taste the flesh not yet deceased
And all I know is still the beast is feeding

And crawling on the planet's face
Some insects called the human race
Lost in time, and lost in space
And meaning
============================================================
Superman
============================================================
So here I am doing everything I can
Holding on to what I am, pretending I'm a superman
I'm trying to keep the ground on my feet
It seems the world's falling down around me
The nights are all long, I'm singing this song
To try and make the answers more than maybe

And I'm so confused about what to do
Sometimes I want to throw it all away

So here I am growing older all the time
Looking older all the time, feeling younger in my mind
And here I am doing everything I can
Holding on to what I am, pretending I'm a superman
I'm trying to sleep, I lost count of sheep
My mind is racing faster every minute
What more could I do*, yeah, I gotta ask you
I know I'm running circles, but I can't quit

And I'm so confused about what to do
Sometimes I want to throw it all away
============================================================
Sure
============================================================
Let the sails catch the wind
Let them grow fat and full
Set out the trawl to catch the animals that look like aliens
The wooden floorboards let out a full and satisfying sound
When you rap your fists against them
Let the sun become hollow
Let the heat from it wash down madly
And let me have a minute of your time

Stop the flood from rushing through its usual motions
Let the rudder lie still
Let the water eat though it
Let its color darken as the day grows older
Let the light break on the water like a bottle on the sidewalk
Let it break against the edges of all everything
And let me have a minute of your time

Watch the current switch direction
Watch the lines there in the center twist and turn
Look back toward the shore where it was a while ago
You know, I can't see it either, can you?
Give me that much at least
That it is far beyond our reach
That it has disappeared from view
And let me have a minute of your time
============================================================
Sure Do Love You Baby, But I Can't Do 60 No More

They had moved down here and you came down too
Where the surf's always wild and the skies are blue
Got my blood pressure measured down in Pahokee
One sixty-five over one twenty-three
And the lights are low over Pompano Beach tonight
And one light is flickering out for the last time

Coconuts growing in the coconut tree
Surf and turf and sand and sea
Down here in the wreckage, just us three
Him and you, you and me
And the lights are low over Pompano Beach tonight
And one light is flickering out
Out for the last time
============================================================
Surrounded
============================================================
Pale white moon shine
Down on Colorado
Hide my dirty secrets
Down here in the shadows
Where the quaking aspens
Tremble in the snow
Haul me up the hillside
Hold me high and let me go

Let me fall right through my own roof like a meteorite
Let the world and all its wonders leave me to my toys tonight
And my ninety-six inch
Television screen
Let me die, let me die
Surrounded by machines

High winds knocked the power out last night
But I've got my own supply here
All my windows blaze with light
And the light spills through the windows
To the empty plain below
Finds nothing but some trees
And six fresh feet of snow

And I find a broadcast station that's signed off for the night
And the static floods the speakers in glorious black and white
On my ninety-six inch television screen
Let me die, let me die
Surrounded by machines
============================================================
TV in Flames

I love...
ah... taking off my...
swollen feet...
This... I... love....

Tahitian Ambrosia Maker
============================================================
We were real hungry and half dead
When you broke out half a loaf of sourdough bread
And in the tropical air, the scent rose like a spirit
Moments of grace like this being wholly unmerited, ah

We were newly alive and I felt your hand on my arm
I was awake to the sensation and immune from all harm
You pressed your soft cheek up against my gut
Pure gold, nothing but gold
And I'm gonna bake you a nice coconut cream pie
'Cause I saw the sky coming down to meet you

Tallahassee (Song)
============================================================
Window facing an ill-kept front yard
Plums on the tree heavy with nectar
Prayers to summon the destroying angel
Moon stuttering in the sky like film stuck in a projector
And you
You

Twin prop airplanes passing loudly overhead
Road to the airport two lanes clear
Half the whole town gone for the summer
Terrible silence coming down here
And you
You

There is no deadline
There is no schedule
There is no plan we can fall back on
The road this far can't be retraced
There is no punch line anybody can tack on
There are loose ends by the score
What did I come down here for?
You
You

Tampa
============================================================
My brother and me found out where you keep your ugly secrets hid
We dug up the missing one this morning
I know why you did what you did
Yeah we found him naked in the snow
Down where the wild crocus grow
And I don't wanna do this anymore
Yeah I ain't wanna fight your dirty little war

Yeah my brother said not to drop another dime 'cause
He ain't comin' out next time, and you can
Soak in a bathtub full of gasoline, but you will
Never get your hands clean

Yeah the building was glowing, fires were raging within
You ran out to save your own skin
Well I probably shouldn't blame you
Yeah I probably shouldn't blame you
But by God, I do
And I found the photographs in the top dresser drawer
But I ain't gonna fight your dirty little war
Anymore

Tape Travel Is Lonely

Peppers on the plants
Plum tomatoes ripening on the vine
Mid-summer evenings on the back porch
Barbecued sweet corn, sweet white wine

When the west wind comes through, it'll rip right through you
When the west wind comes through, it'll rip right through you

Bottle after bottle of the cheap stuff
Feeling two degrees north of alright
Heaven help us, heaven help us
Or we're all gonna die tonight

When the west wind comes through, it'll rip right through you
When the west wind comes through, it'll rip right through you

Party goes on 'til the end of August
The tensions build, the air currents throb
Mosquitoes suck the blood out of my body
Why don't they finish the job

When the west wind comes through, it'll rip right through you
When the west wind comes through, it'll rip right through you

Teenage World

You bought me a rabbit to keep me company
And I'm here in my car and the rabbit's here with me
Heading out Highway One, respecting posted speed limits
And I've tried to figure this one out but I can't find any meaning in it

And I'm sick and tired of trying to figure out your gestures
And I'm sick and tired of wondering what your presents mean
I'm gonna take this rabbit into Malibu
And he'll chew on sourgrass while I wolf down Dexedrine
Dexedrine

The wind comes through the open window and I button my shirt
And the rabbit's riding shotgun, my teeth hurt
You sent me a package marked "live animals inside"
And the sun's coming up quickly above the rising tide

And I'm sick and tired of trying to figure out your gestures
And I'm sick and tired of wondering what your presents mean
I'm gonna take this rabbit into Malibu
And he'll chew on sourgrass while I wolf down Dexedrine

Tell Me on a Sunday
============================================================
Don't write a letter
When you want to leave
Don't call me at three A.M. from your friend's apartment
I'd like to choose
How I hear the news
Take me to a park that's covered with trees
Tell me on a Sunday please

Let me down easy, no big song and dance
No long faces, no long looks, no deep conversation
I know the way
I wanna spend that day
Take me to the zoo
With the big chimpanzees
Tell me on a Sunday please

Don't want to know who's to blame
It won't help knowing
I don't want to fight day and night
It's bad enough that you're going
Don't leave in silence, with no words at all
Don't get mad and slam the door
It's no way to end this
I know how I
Want you to say goodbye
Find a circus tent with a big trapeze
Tell me on a Sunday please

I don't want to fight day and night
It's bad enough that you're going
Don't leave in silence, with no word at all
Don't get mad and slam the door
It's no way to end this
I know how I
Want you to say goodbye

Don't run off in the pouring rain
Don't call me as they call your plane
Take the hurt out of all the pain
Take me to a park that's covered with trees
Tell me on a Sunday please

The train touched down in Sioux City, Iowa
The train touched down in Sioux City, Iowa
It fell cleanly from the dark sky onto the track
Saw you from the window, there was no turning back

Well, the whistle went off, I was breathing up against the window
Yeah, the whistle went off, I was breathing up against the window
I saw familiar passengers walking past me
And you'd called up the cavalry
It was so easy, and it was so hard
You were clutching your copy of Kierkegaard

Thank You Mario But Our Princess Is in Another Castle
============================================================
I waited here all by myself
The room was dark and it smelled like sulfur
I heard the screams from way down in the darkness
Felt pretty sure my life was over

I kept my hat on just for luck
Sang simple tunes the whole night through
I wondered if I'd wake to find myself in flames
As I waited here for you

Yeah when you came in
I could breathe again

I saw some guys dressed up like sorcerers
Blue robes that flowed above the ground
They came and went and I was frightened for my life
I tried not to make a sound

Just when my solitude was closing in
I heard a howl like screeching tires
And I told you the one thing I know how to say
Through the bright ringing drone of 8-bit choirs

Yeah when you came in
I could breathe again
============================================================
Thanks for the Dress
============================================================
The young sun
The old story forming
Hasn't been the same
Since dad came by this morning
Did you see the way mom's looking at us
Mark it well

Your eyes meet mine
When we hear her call
The strange birds in the yard
Are perched above the symbols that she painted on the garden wall
Did you see the way mom's looking at us
Did you see the way mom's looking at us
Don't say anything
============================================================
That
============================================================
I will praise your eyes
For burning my house down
I am humbled by how they made the framework fall to the ground
I stood with you and watched you
As you made it burn and fall
In minutes it was almost like it had never even been there at all

When the traffic on this street
Thins out for just a second
I will look into your eyes
I, I will not panic
I am standing on the corner
Where you and I were standing
I am trying to look at the sky
But there are too many colors surrounding me

I will praise your eyes
They have reduced this city to embers
I will see you coming
I will see your eyes through the cold air from a mile away

That Hippolytine Feeling
============================================================
We sat together on the porch
As the sunset bled
And you playfully leveled your semi-automatic handgun
Right at my head
And then God, in another stroke of his genius
He opened up the floodgates
And the bulls came out
And the bulls came out

We heard the heavy hooves beating on the earth
As the moment came near
I felt the chamber of your pistol kissing my jaw
I felt your red lips brushing my ear
And then God, convincing if not transparent in his motives
He opened up the floodgates
But the rivers were dry, 'cause it was late August
And the bulls came out
And the bulls came out

Tell me why when you got caught in it you told the same lie
That was not a nice thing to do
Not a nice thing to do
Wasn't very nice of you
Not a nice thing to do

Tell me why

Tell me why you made threats against the life of the prime minister of Canada
That was not a nice thing to do

Kick in as the sun began to blaze
I saw you walk across the plaza
Figured I'd just play it like it lays
Yeah yeah yeah

I think I'm gonna be real sick again
I think it's gonna happen real soon
And I know I can't afford another night here in this place
With its sixteenth floor view of the ocean and the dunes
And it's gonna be just you and me today
Waiting for the other shoe to drop in Tampa Bay

I could hear the roar of the crowd
In the stadium a couple blocks away
It's the kind of thing that used to get me all worked up
But I don't want to talk about it now okay okay
Okay

I just want to get this whole thing over with
I don't want to deal with it anymore
I hear the cogs all slipping at the same time
And then I see you walk in through the door
And it's gonna be just you and me today
Waiting for the other shoe to drop in Tampa Bay

Yeah the Anglo-Saxons
A sub-literate bunch of guys
Though some sources say otherwise
Yeah the Anglo-Saxons

Yeah they were men on a mission
Preserving their poetry by an oral tradition
Yeah oral tradition was all you'd get
Until Saint Augustine brought them the alphabet
Yeah the Anglo-Saxons
Yeah the Anglo-Saxons

Yeah in 1065 they were ragin'
But 1066 brought the Norman Invasion
Yeah the Anglo-Saxons

Remember the first days in california


You don't wanna see these guys

Fat rich men love their 12-year-olds
Deco cufflinks and cognac by the glass
Look West from London
toward the emerald city
Remember Minnesota

You don't wanna see these guys
without their masks on
You don't wanna see these guys
without their masks on

Or their gloves...

Sweet spearmint and bitter tangerine
Bedside decked with roses
Look West look West
look West and look away
From old familiar faces

You don't wanna see these guys

The Bad Doctor
============================================================
If you were anywhere near his door
You saw it swing open and you heard the moon roar
Trying to yank herself right out of her orbit
The whole natural world painted red, just like a target

It was a cold dark day
With low clouds standing in the way
And the stars jockeying for position
On the slow thick morning of the death-dealing physician
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

And you could feel his features in the air
A wide smile and perfect hair
He had complete control of the rising tides
And a medicine bag hanging at his side

It was a cold dark day
With low clouds standing in the way
And the stars jockeying for position
In the flowing blue world of the death-dealing physician
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

And the rain came down like water from a faucet
I saw him at the crossroads but I never saw him cross it
One minute he was on this side, and the next he was over on the other
So went his rounds, one sad patient after another

It was a cold dark day
With low clouds standing in the way
And the stars jockeying for position
In the crushed velvet world of the death-dealing physician

It was a cold dark day
With low clouds standing in the way
And the stars jockeying for position
In the impossibly large office of the death-dealing physician
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

The Ballad of Bull Ramos
============================================================
Drive a great big truck
When I'm old, when I'm old
Haul the wrecks down to the wreck yard
Help the boys unload
Keep my hair nice and long
Because I can, because I can
Any of my old friends who have no place to turn to
They know to call me any time they come through

Never die, never die
Stand with a bullwhip in my hand
And rise, rise
In the desert sand

Work days, work nights
Finally get laid up
By a piece of broken glass
On the floor of the shop
And the doctor recognizes me
As the operating theater goes dim
Aren't you that old wrestler with the bullwhip?
Yes sir, that's me, I'm him

Get around fine on one leg
Lose a kidney, then go blind
Sit on my porch in Houston
Let the good times dance across my mind

Never die, never die
Stand with a bullwhip in my hand
And rise, rise
Surrounded by friends

The Best Ever Death Metal Band in Denton
============================================================
the best ever death metal band out of Denton
were a couple of guys, who'd been friends since grade school.
one was named Cyrus, and the other was Jeff.
and they practiced twice a week in Jeff's bedroom.

the best ever death metal band out of Denton
never settled on a name.
but the top three contenders, after weeks of debate,
were Satan's Fingers, and the Killers, and the Hospital Bombers.

Jeff and Cyrus believed in their hearts they were headed
for stage lights and Learjets, and fortune and fame.
so in script that made prominent use of a pentagram,
they stenciled their drumheads and guitars with their names.

this was how Cyrus got sent to the school
where they told him he'd never be famous.
and this was why Jeff,

The Big Unit
============================================================
I sunk all of my money into Swiss gold
And I watched the market slide
And I stood on the edge of the Pacific and watched
The hypodermic needles coming in with the tide
There are two guys just outside of Chicago
Looking for me tonight
But Randy Johnson throws a baseball 97 miles an hour and
I'm gonna be all right

I had a fully loaded junk bond portfolio that
Didn't work out like it was supposed to
There's a mountain of money in the bond market
That I can't seem to get close to
I've been headed down the road to ruin
The end is nowhere in sight
But Randy Johnson throws a baseball 97 miles an hour and
I'm gonna be all right
============================================================
The Black Ice Cream Song
============================================================
And the heat came down
And the heat came down
I knew I was living in a long, long dream
when you fed me the black ice cream

And the heat rose up
And the heat rose up
I heard the loud loud buzzing of our son's go-kart
And the ice cream was blacker than the devil's heart
It was August the 19th, 1957
I fixed my eyes on you, fixed my eyes on you
============================================================
The Boys Are Back in Town
============================================================
Guess who just got back today
Them wild-eyed boys that had been away
Hadn't changed, hadn't much to say
I still think those guys are great

They were asking if you'd been around
How you was, where you could be found
Told them you were living downtown
Driving all the old men crazy

The boys are back in town
(boys are back in town)
The boys are back in town

You remember that chick that used to dance a lot
Every night she'd be on the floor shaking what she'd got
Man, when I tell you she was cool, she was red hot
I mean she was steamin'

Then that time over at Johnny's place
This chick, she got up and she slapped Johnny's face
Man, we just fell about the place
If that chick don't wanna know, forget her

The boys are back in town
(the boys are back in town)
I said the boys are back in town

Spread the word around
Guess who's back in town
Spread the word around

Friday night they'll be dressed to kill
Down at Dino's Bar and Grill
The drink will flow and blood will spill
And if the boys want to fight, you'd better let them

That jukebox over in the corner blasting out my favorite song
The nights are getting warmer and it won't be long
Won't be long till summer comes
Now that the boys are here again

The boys are back in town
(boys are back in town)
I said the boys are back in town
The boys are back in town
(the boys are back, boys are back, boys are back)
The boys are back in town, yeah
============================================================
The Car Song
============================================================
The highway's open and the sun is full
And the vinyl upholstery heats up like worsted wool
The hills roll past us, then they rear up again
Take a deep breath now and count to ten
I reach across the stick shift and I pull you near
The highway's open and it's hot in here, it's hot in here

Your skin sends all the sunlight back to hell
And you shine in the coming darkness and I guess it's just as well
That there's no one left, there's no one left at all
And then the hills behind your eyes start burning
Like a solid wall of licking flames
They burn red and clear
The highway's open and it's hot in here, it's hot in here
============================================================
The Coast of High Barbary
============================================================
There were two lovely ships
From old England came
Blow high, blow low
And so sail we
One was the Prince of Lutheran
And the other Prince of Wales
Cruising down along the coast
Of the High Barbary

Aloft there, aloft there
Our jolly boatswain cries
Blow high, blow low
And so sail we
But look aloft, and look astern
Look a-weather and a-lee
Cruising down along the coasts
Of the High Barbary

There's naught upon the stern
There's naught upon the lee
Blow high, blow low
And so sail we
But there's a lofty ship windward
And she's sailing fast and free
Cruising down along the coasts
Of the High Barbary

Oh hail her, oh hail her
Our gallant captain cried
Blow high, blow low
And so sail we
Are you a man of war
Or a privateer says he
Cruising down along the coast
Of the High Barbary

Well I am not a man of war
Nor a privateer says he
Blow high, blow low
And so sail we
But I'm a salt-sea pirate
A-looking for my fee
Cruising down along the coast
Of the High Barbary

'Twas broadside to broadside
A long time we lay
Blow high, blow low
And so sail we
Until the Prince of Lutheran shot
The pirates' masts away
Cruising down along the coast
Of the High Barbary

Oh mercy, oh mercy
Those pirates then did cry
Blow high, blow low
And so sail we
But the mercy that we gave them
We sank them in the sea
Cruising down along the coast
Of the High Barbary
============================================================
The Coroner's Gambit (Song)
============================================================
When death came calling today
I heard the gentle grace of his cadences
I couldn't say no
I couldn't say no

When he showed me his new silk scarves
Laid out on a shiny black plastic tray
Couldn't say, couldn't say, couldn't say, couldn't say, couldn't say no
I couldn't say no

And I'm sorry I couldn't
You know how badly I wanted to
Didn't want, didn't want, didn't want, didn't want, didn't wanna lose you

But his smile was dazzling
And his eyes were sparkling
Like moonlight on the water at midnight
Couldn't say, couldn't say, couldn't say, couldn't say, couldn't say, couldn't say no
I couldn't say no
============================================================
The Cow Song
============================================================
Bang, pow! Look at me now
Don't let the cows stray off too far
Come down, take a good look around
See how the cows start to shine like light bulbs

I love the cows
I love the cows
I love the cows, yeah
I love the cows

Rain comes, strikes you dumb
Re-seed the meadow so the cows don't starve
Mud puddle it's a fine place to cuddle
If you're a mosquito or a mosquito's baby

I love the cows
I love the cows
I love the cows
I love the cows

They're smiling in your face
All the time they wanna take your place
Yeah you know who I mean
Talkin' about those cow-machines

I love the cows
I love the cows
I love the cows
I love the cows
============================================================
The Day the Aliens Came (Hawaiian Feeling)
============================================================
I will wake up at six A.M. again
And I will find my way to the front door
Like a soldier crawling through the smoking carnage
Smoldering bodies at my feet
I'd love to stick around but I've got someone to meet
And I will put my best foot forward
And I'll thank God I made it out of there
On the day when my new friends come

I will present myself in my nice white tuxedo jacket
And I will look out at the day through my dark sunglasses
And take in the scene
The house behind me and the people in it
Will all go up like steam in just a minute
There's gonna be a redefining of some borders
And I will receive my orders
On the day when my new friends come

The rooftops and the sidewalks
Will all melt like plastic
And oh friends, old friends, dear friends
I'm gonna look fantastic

There won't be any reason left to cry
'Cause there won't be any people left to cry for
My memory's gonna vaporize itself
And my Italian shoes, well they will be to die for
I believe I can fly
Might you look up at me and wave goodbye
On the day when my new friends come
============================================================
The Destruction of the Kola Superdeep Borehole Tower
============================================================
Stick bright reflective tape to the collar of your shirt
Mind your business and you won't get hurt
Be true to the things you said you'd be true to
Always keep your objective in view

Keep two working contacts among your effects
See the tall poppies with their tender fragile necks
Solomon in all his glory not arrayed like these
Bending in the wind like pilgrims on their knees

Those who came to learn these lessons
Left no trace of their presence

Always have a flashlight, just in case
Show the world your true face
Burn such fuel as you need to burn
Learn to wait your turn

Count the heads in the bunks before you turn in for the night
Lace your boots up tight
Secure the rope to the pole
Keep a sense of wonder when you finally reach your goal

Those who came to learn these lessons
Left no trace of their presence

Leave nothing behind
Keep a positive thought in your mind
If you can't find anything nice to say
Drift away

Retain a sense of grace when it's time to cut the cord
Crack through the crust, fall to your knees, and praise the Lord
Listen for the voices calling out from down below
Steady as you go
What will they say back home about you
Who always kept your objective in view
Whose effects included contacts that finally got found
Inside the Arctic Circle, scattered on the ground

Those who came to learn these lessons
Left no trace of their presence
============================================================
The Diaz Brothers
============================================================
Cops and robbers, strictly bargain line
Spend the wet night tracking visions through the pines
Draw my arms into my hospital gown
See the sky open up and rain down
Rain down

Mercy for the Diaz brothers
Mercy for the Diaz brothers

Hear my rivals on the western wind
Hard to know who might or might not be your friend
Work by the plutonian light
Forbidden rosary prayers all night
All night

Mercy for the Diaz brothers
Mercy for the Diaz brothers

Beam of a flashlight
All night in the woods
Hunt us like dogs
And then string us up for good

Keep one step ahead of enemies
Foretell worse things than such frightful nights as these
Lead us to the beach by our hands
And bury us there in the sand

Mercy for the Diaz brothers
Mercy for the Diaz brothers
Mercy for the Diaz brothers
Mercy for the Diaz brothers
============================================================
The Doll Song
============================================================
I had seven little dolls
In a bag
And I tell them my troubles
And the dolls say "Nag, nag, nag, nag"
It's all you ever do
Is that all you're capable of?
And I said to the little dolls
You have no compassion
Baby I'm talking to inanimate objects over you
I'm talking to inanimate objects over you

I was reading the Bible
I Corinthians 13
Where Paul talks all about love
But I don't know what he means
Because he says that love is kind
That has not been my experience
So I set the Bible on the kitchen table
And yelled at the Bible until I was no longer able baby
I'm talking to inanimate objects over you
I'm talking to inanimate objects over you
Yeah I'm talking to inanimate objects over you
Yeah I'm talking to inanimate objects over you
============================================================
The Floating Gardens
============================================================
I came clean down to Mexico for you.
What else would you have me do?
The bills were stacking up daily,
There were predators at my door.
Drooling like hungry jackals,
I made my mind up to track you down.
You were standing above the tall tall reeds
Chewing on pumpkin seeds.
You've got you money invested in gold futures now
And you're waiting for me to come,
Well, I'm coming.

You left a mountain of bad debt behind you.
Yeah, back in California where the cops came to find you
But when they came, they found me instead
Pacing the floors wondering whether you were dead
And half way hoping, hoping half the other way
And now you're standing among the tall tall reeds
Lit up like a Christmas tree,
You've got your money invested in gold futures now
And you're waiting for the rain to come,
Well, I'm coming.
============================================================
The Fringe
============================================================
Too many lines - no direction.
Too many times - no direction.
Assume any time more should be done.
But, for now, just pick out the eggshells.
============================================================
The Garden Song
============================================================
I see the flowers in your garden are in bloom
I see the flags are flying high
I hear you've gone and rearranged things in your room
I guess you're trying to cut-off my air supply

I came toward your window, real slowly
I knew deep down I was about to strike oil
I guess by the now the flowers in your garden know me
I felt them trying to get at me through the soil

My bare feet felt the cool, soft dirt
Moving up my ankles, but I don't fear you
The thorns began tearing at my shirt
But I didn't even care when they tore clear through

Your garden can't hurt me
Your flowers don't threaten my life
Your garden can't hurt me anymore
Your flowers don't threaten my life
============================================================
The Great Gold Sheep
============================================================
I'm going to do what I like
I'm going to live how I want
I'm going to build myself a great estate
With lots of statues out front

Choirs from the Curtis Institute
Singing me to sleep
Wake up and worship the great gold sheep

I'm going to walk the pathways of the ancients
I'm going to let my name be known
I'm going to seek the wild haunts of this world
And carve a place out all my own

Heat up the iron until it glows
Burn the brand so deep
Wake up and worship the great gold sheep

There's only one, splendid and fine
The ages attest it's wondrous design
You and me stand somehow above the fray
And name everyone who's throwing their chance away

I'm going to write my name on everything
I'm going to leave a lasting legacy
And when my body's thrown with great force from a window
The dogs will fight for whatever's left of me

Shallow grave among the weeds
Where the pale worms creep
Wake up and worship the great gold sheep
============================================================
The Grey King and the Silver Flame Attunement
============================================================
In the secret caverns underneath West Covina
Half desperate for peace
With the surface dwellers
But coming to no conclusions
And now we emerge
Sky grey and misty

The Grey King in his new Pontiac
Some of us sworn to the effort
Trying to get our shapes back
Teeth filed down to fine points
Framework too tight
Strain at the joints

And I'm hardcore but I'm not that hardcore
I'm hardcore but I'm not that hardcore
I'm hardcore but I'm not that hardcore
I'm pretty hardcore but I'm not that hardcore

Load into the Grand Am
Doomed sailors
Borne high by the waves
Wild with wonder
Leather and lace and good friends
Most of them good
Most of them friendly

The Grey King at the rail, sparks flying
Three of us in the car with him
Scared of dying
All eyes on the front seat
Assuming his form
Reborn in the heat

And I'm hardcore but I'm not that hardcore
I'm hardcore but I'm not that hardcore
I'm hardcore but I'm not that hardcore
I'm pretty hardcore but I'm not that hardcore

The Hissing of Summer Lawns
============================================================
He bought her a diamond for her throat
He put her in a ranch house on the hill
She could see the valley barbecues
From her window sill
See the blue pools in the squinting sun
Hear the hissing of summer lawns

He put up a barbed wire fence
To keep out the unknown
And on every metal thorn
Just a little blood of his own
She patrols that fence of his
To a Latin drum
And the hissing of summer lawns
Darkness
Wonder makes it easy
Darkness
With a joyful mask
Darkness
Tube's gone, darkness, darkness, darkness
No color no contrast

Diamond dog
Carrying a cup and a cane
Looking through a double glass
Looking at too much pride and too much shame
There's a black fly buzzing
There's a heat wave burning in her master's voice
Hissing summer lawns

He gave her his darkness to regret
And good reason to quit him
He gave her a roomful of Chippendale
That nobody sits in
Still she stays with a love of some kind
It's the lady's choice
The hissing of summer lawns
============================================================
The Hot Garden Stomp
============================================================
The room was unbearably hot
Flowering plant that hung from the radiator pipe
It was dripping sweat from its rapidly fading petals
And to the humming world in which I was living

A crescendoing stepping sound came in
I heard you stepping over three weeks' worth of newspapers
Piled up outside the door

I hear you knocking
Come in
Turn on the radio
Turn up the volume

You sat down in the same place where you used to sit
It brought back a memory or two
I may not know much any more, but I remember you

You were quiet for a while and that was nice
Then you came along with your questions, always questions
I don't have any answers to those particular questions

I hear you talking
Shut up
Turn on the radio
Turn up the volume
============================================================
The House That Dripped Blood
============================================================
Look beyond the broken bottles
Past the rotting wooden stairs
Root out the wine-dark honeyed center
Not everyone can live like millionaires

Look through the air-thin walls
Tear up the floorboards strip the paint
Go over every inch of space
With the patience of a saint
Grab your hat get your coat
The cellar door is an open throat

Look past the kitchen cabinets
Go through the chest of drawers
Scrutinize the casements
Rip the varnish off the doors
Dig up the laughing photographs
They're here somewhere or other
Take what you can carry
But let me tell you brother
Still waters go stagnant
Bodies bloat
And the cellar door is an open throat
============================================================
The Irony Engine
============================================================
You kept a death grip on the armrest
You slept as I swerved through bumps and dips
You leapt at the chance to act alarmist
You swept past my face like an eclipse

You act like I'm your chum and I can treat you like my little sister
But if you cover the sun with your thumb you should expect to get a fever blister
And if the air is filled with a sickening hum
Don't be upset or overcome
Don't worry
It's just the irony engine working

You rose like a crane to the occasion
You froze at the very implication
You chose to divert the whole invasion
By winking and shrugging and smiling and giving me an awkward seatbelt hug
Before you vanished in the chilly autumn
I could feel the motor chug
Something tearing loose and striking bottom
But if you still can't see how a three point plug
Could supervene on the lunar tug
Don't worry
It's just the irony engine working
Don't worry
It's just the irony engine working
============================================================
The Lady from Shanghai
============================================================
The waves were beating
Against the shore
The waves were beating
As if they hadn't before
The dock was soaking
The wood was wet
Your hair blew madly
I can't forget
We went down to the boat
We went down to the boat
We went down to the boat
We went down to the boat
Yeah

The rushing water
The pale sky
Hey that's a good way
To let the deck dry
You know what I mean
We were slaves
The world was lurching
The dark way
As we went down to the boat
We went down to the boat
We went down to the boat
We went down to the boat
Yeah
============================================================
The Last Day of Jimi Hendrix's Life
============================================================
On the last day of his life, Jimi Hendrix woke up
And made his way down the hall
And he adjusted the knobs in the shower 'til the water came out just the way he liked it
It was hot, but not too hot
It was hot, but not too hot

On the last afternoon of his life, Jimi Hendrix went to the kitchen
And he got himself a glass of water
He put four ice cubes into the glass
There is nothing like cold water
There is nothing
============================================================
The Last Limit of Bhakti
============================================================
Let me serve you with my mind
Let me serve you with my mind
Let me leave this grieving sand and sky far behind

Let me serve you with my tongue
Let me serve you with my tongue
Let me say your name all day 'til my mouth goes numb

And when the sun comes up
Open up the blind
Let me hear the machines' great gears squeal and grind

Yeah, let me serve you 'til it's over
Let me serve you 'til it's all over
When the world is giving your secrets all away
Let me give you cover

Let me serve you with my body
Let me serve you with my body
Let me find now until the end of time
The last limit
Yeah yeah
============================================================
The Last Place I Saw You Alive
============================================================
I'm not thinking of you
When I swing left onto Gordon Avenue
It's just the way the traffic veers
Haven't driven down these streets in years

But then I pass the last place I saw you alive

I walk the narrow path these days
I can't see going back to my old ways
Call to mind sometimes that bloody, stinking mess
Us worms turn into butterflies I guess

But then I pass the last place I saw you alive

It's changed since you were here, or else it hasn't
It was special, it was deadly,
It was ours and then it wasn't

It's only now and then you come to mind
There's a trillion things you left behind
It's just the way the math works out
Nothing really to get worked up about

But then I pass the last place I saw you alive
============================================================
The Legend of Chavo Guerrero
============================================================
Born down in El Paso, where the tumbleweeds blow
To the middleweight champ of all of Mexico
Dad fought many bloody battles, and he raised four sons
Chavo was the oldest one

Old man Gory could pop, like a live grenade
Raised his boys in the way of the trade
Hector and Mando, young Eddy G
Chavo meant the most to me

Look high, it's my last hope
Chavo Guerrero, coming off the top rope

He came from Texas seeking fortune and fame
Rose pretty quickly to the top of the game
Defender of the downtrodden, king of the hill
Tag team champion with Al Madril

Before a black-and-white TV in the middle of the night
I'm lying on the floor, I'm bathed in blue light
The telecast's in Spanish, I can understand some
And I need justice in my life, here it comes

Look high, it's my last hope
Chavo Guerrero, coming off the top rope

Red Shoes Dugan, holding his arm high all out of breath
I hated all of Chavo's enemies, I would pray nightly for their death
Descending like fire on the people who deserved it most
Almost completely unknown outside of Texas and on the West Coast

He was my hero back when I was a kid
You let me down but Chavo never once did
You called him names to try to get beneath my skin
Now your ashes are scattered on the wind

I heard his son got famous and he went nationwide
Coast to coast, with his dad by his side
I don't know if that's true, but I've been told
It's real sweet to grow old

Look high, it's my last hope
Chavo Guerrero, coming off the top rope
============================================================
The Longest Winter
============================================================
The long lost winter acceptance woes
A lasting slumber a sickness flows
The last of summer the longing rivers froze
A grasping hunger as darkness grows

Feeling so alive in this hopeless dream
Feeling so alive in this hopeless dream

The frost of winter, acceptance shows
A grasping hunger as fever grows
At last the summer the longing rivers flow
The lasting thunder, as darkness grows

Feeling so alive in this hopeless dream
Feeling so alive in this hopeless dream
============================================================
The Look of the Pet
============================================================
You're still here at my front door.
You look obscenely at me.
Be glad you're not trapped in a tunnel.
============================================================
The Mad Clarinet
============================================================
I don't mean to scare you, you're leaving soon
But the wallpaper's melting, thoughts turning blue
The lightbulb is giving out shots in the dark
And the mad clarinet's run away with your heart

Remember that old tune
The one that you cried to when you fell
Yeah it felt like you'd lost your mind

You were not twenty-one when he first saw you
How his melody cheered you, pitch rang so true
Placed your lips to the mouthpiece, struck out a part
Now the mad clarinet's run away with your heart

Do you remember that old tune
The one that you cried to when you fell
It felt like you'd lost your mind

When you left that sucker on a moonlit night
You didn't bother looking left or you wouldn't look right
You nearly got run over by a ten ton truck
Got your pride you tried to make out like you

When he received you, your hope simply fell through
So you cried
Yeah it felt like you'd lost your mind
============================================================
The Mess Inside
============================================================
we took a weekend, drove to Provo.
the snow was white and fluffy.
but a weekend in Utah won't fix what's wrong with us.
the gray sky was vast and real cryptic above me.
I wanted you to love me like you used to do.

we took two weeks in the Bahamas.
went out dancing every night.
tried to fight the creeping sense of dread with temporal things.
most of the time I guess I felt alright.
but I wanted you to love me like you used to do.

but you cannot run
and you cannot hide,
from the wreck we've made of our house,
and from the mess inside.

we went down to New Orleans
one weekend in the spring.
looked hard for what we'd lost.
it was painful to admit it, but we couldn't find a thing.
I wanted you to love me like you used to do.

we went to New York City in September.
took the train out of Manhattan to the Grand Army stop.
found that bench we'd sat together on a thousand years ago
when I felt such love for you I thought my heart was gonna pop.
I wanted you to love me like you used to do.

but I cannot run.
and I can't hide.
from the wreck we've made of our house.
from the mess inside.
============================================================
The Monkey Song
============================================================
Cool air falls through the venetian blinds and the
Planets in the heavens are perfectly aligned
I take in my surroundings
I memorize them all
The scuff marks on the stone floor
The powder burns on the eastern wall

There's a monkey in the basement
How did the monkey get there?
There's a monkey in the basement
Where did the monkey come from?
Where did the monkey come from?
Where did the monkey come from?

The animal noises you used to make
The Andalusian coral snake
All pale when standing beside this room
And the heavy hot rains and the sonic boom

There's a monkey in the basement
Where did the monkey come from?
There's a monkey in the basement
How did the monkey get there?
How did the monkey get there?
How did the monkey get there?
============================================================
The Monolith
============================================================
As I stared into the darkness
Red eyes stared back at me
Burning circles through fumes and fire
Mystic symbols and ancient runes
Risen high through the fog
A statue green from age
Spirits howling incantation

All hail Satan
Your envoy is at hand
The monolith
Eyes red as fire
A body built of souls
Of those who seek him

At the edge of time and space
Descent to meet my fate
I saw the faces of a thousand demons
As I passed on through the gate
Risen high through the fog
A statue green from age
Spirits howling incantation

All hail Satan
Your envoy is at hand
The monolith
Eyes red as fire
A body built of souls
Of those who seek him

All hail Satan
Your envoy is at hand
The monolith
Eyes red as fire
A body built of souls
Of those who seek him

All hail Satan
Your envoy is at hand
The monolith
Eyes red as fire
A body built of souls
Of those who seek him
============================================================
The Moon
============================================================
I thought that I was in control
When I saw her coming, and I reached out my hand
You, you, you would think so too
But there is something here that you do not understand
She's got skin that you would not believe
I saw her skin and I went out of my mind
She's got skin more perfect than the sky
And I reached out my hand and left the world behind

Before I knew what I was talking about
I used to say that what I saw through my window
Was beauty itself, those strong white camellias
But now I see her coming, and I just don't think so
She's got skin that cannot be obtained
By letting yourself in for a thousand stitches
I reached out my hand and I walked out into the rain
There was light behind the clouds
You could just see it coming
============================================================
The Moon Song
============================================================
Dead quiet three hours into the best part of the day
And I, I want to tell you that you look so pretty
But the words come out wrong and the rage gets in the way
Dead silence, you looked at me like you were looking into space
And in space, no one could hear you say good-bye
Down here I shouldn't have to read it on your face

That's not normal
That's not right
That's not very nice
No it isn't

The moon shining down on your body and you look so nice
And I, I want to tell you, but you don't want to hear it
And I know and you don't have to tell me twice
But once would be civil
The moon shining got into my brain, and I had so much to say
But there was dead quiet, and you were silent
Three hours into the best part of the day

And that's not normal
That's not right
That's not very nice
No it isn't

And that's not normal
That's not right
That's not very nice
No it isn't

The Muffin Man

Do you know the muffin man, the muffin man, the muffin man?
Do you know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane?

Oh yes we know the muffin man, the muffin man, the muffin man?
Hell yes we know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane?

The Mummy's Hand
============================================================
If you prick us, don't it sting
if you kick us, won't it hurt
I am wrapped in scraps of linen and pieces of people's old shirts
But way way underneath all these sticky bands
I hold all my dreams right here in my hands

I will rise from the tomb
Like an infant emerging from the womb

I spent several thousand years down here all alone
No way to stem the lonely old ache in my bones
Say the spell three times, crank up the special effects
I'm gonna cast off all my bandages and see what happens next

I will rise fully formed
Like an infant, freshly born

I've been trapped too long underneath the ground
In the hollow darkness, but ain't no grave gonna hold my body down
I will push my hand up through the earth
and I will rise like the cry of an infant at its birth
============================================================
The New Hydra Collection
============================================================
Down in the lab
With the hopeful few
Hell bent on doing
The work that you cowards won't do
Weaving the future
From bright new threads
Prices on their heads

Someday the abomination
Is going to finally make land
We stay silent as a snowdrift
Focused on the task at hand
Dream of the day
When the calm waters break
And something rises from the lake

Someday, all of you people will know
The safe way isn't the only way to go

Movement in the grid
As fish leap in the air
It's only a test run
And still the tension's too delicious to bear
All around the monitor station
Big smiles, high fives
According to my projections
Everybody's going to run for their lives

Still we wait until our time has come
Down here where the engines hum
Exiled priests of Rome
Bringing our troubles back home

Someday, all of you people will know
The safe way isn't the only way to go
============================================================
The New Potatoes
============================================================
The rain came and washed the new potatoes away
We saw them floating across the backyard
There they go
We'll never see them again, you know
So goodbye to the new potatoes
Goodbye and godspeed

There they go
We will never see them again you know
So goodbye to the new potatoes
Goodbye
Goodbye
============================================================
The Only Thing I Know
============================================================
When you came back from Trenton
All the sparkle was gone
You stood in the shadow
And the curtains were drawn

And I know you're lying
And you know you're lying too
That is just about the only thing I know about you

When you pocketed your eyeshadow
And you picked up the phone
Stepped out on the balcony
And drank in the drone

And I know you're leaving
And you know you're leaving too
That is just about the only thing I know about you

And you stopped on the sidewalk
And you looked up above you
Warm wet air came down to shelter me
How much do I love you

Well you know you're dying
And I know you're dying too
That is just about the only thing I know about you
============================================================
The Pieman
============================================================
For days I watched you from my place
A thousand miles away in space
Remembering your body, how it it turned me into what I am now
I have not broken any laws
To work toward my stupid cause
I can see you now from where I am
I can see you completely

I planted hedges of hydrangea
Because you were going to Pennsylvania
And i didn't know what else to do
I wanted to put my hands on you
I wanted to tell you everything
But I ended up here orbiting
I can see you now
I can feel you now
From where I am, I can see you completely

I went into your room
It got so crazy in there
The air turned hot and I saw them
But I didn't read your letters
I will never bleed like I used to bleed again
I can't bleed like normal men
But I can see you
My heart beats like a magic drum
From where I am, I can see you completely
============================================================
The Pig Song
============================================================
Oh, I'm just a pig in the sun
Friend to everyone
When the sun shines high
In the eastern sky
I sing [pig snorting noises

Pig life is the life for me
Diligent but free
Do my work then rest
Sing a song when pressed
That goes [pig snorting noises

May we all live long on the Earth
Come to learn what true friendship is worth
Friends since birth
From the depths of our girth
We sing [pig snorting noises
============================================================
The Plague
============================================================
There will be blue skies
Above the green and verdant plain
Churns will swell with fresh butter
There will be an abundance of sweet grain
And we will rise from our sleep
We won't have time to choose what things we'll keep

And rivers will all turn to blood
Frogs will fall from the sky
And the plague will rage through the countryside
La la la la
La la la la
La la la, la la la, la la la

There will be cotton clouds
Above the fields as white as cream
There will be loud singing in the churches
As we all come out to take one for the team
And all our great schemes and plans
Will slip like fishes from our hands

And rivers will all turn to blood
Frogs will fall from the sky
And the plague will cover the country with its anger
La la la la
La la la la
La la la, la la la, la la la
Hey
============================================================
The Recognition Scene
============================================================
we broke the doorknob off of the door.
the door swung open easily.
we sauntered into the poorly lit store,
and looked around lazily.
we stole every bit of candy they had inside.
gobbled it all up greedily on our 3 month ride.
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone.
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone.

you headed out to the getaway car
and hit the open road
I saw something written in tall clear letters on your face
but I could not break the code.
we had hot caramel sticking to our teeth
and the only love I've ever known burning underneath
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone.
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone.

I'm gonna miss you when you're gone.
I'm gonna miss you when you're gone.

The River Sane
============================================================
They found a spaceship in the river.
down by the River Sane.
What they saw did make them quiver.
The River Sane will fool the lot of you.
Let's go swim down by the river sane.
============================================================
The River Song
============================================================
The little river is blue and long
I sat by the side of it as everything went wrong
I got a letter from the dry city's heart
You say the water distribution system's come all apart
And my place here's threatened
But I had it in my mind
And your face was on the skyline, so sweet and so kind
Let them come
Let 'em all come down
Let them take a good long look around
Let them see if my rivers won't suit them
Let them drown

The fish that swim there in the current
With their machine-like faces should be no deterrent
They'll all come toward me
But I won't move
I know where I stand, I have nothing to prove

Because I had it in my heart that you were walking by
And the little river's waters became our separate skies
So let them come
Let 'em all come down
Let them take a good long look around
Let them see if my rivers won't suit them
Let them drown

Because I had it in my heart that you were walking by
And the whole world dissolved leaving only you and I
So let them come
Let 'em all come down
Let them take a good long look around
Let them see if my rivers won't suit them
Let them drown
============================================================
The Sign
============================================================
(spoken) Never get tired of this one.

I've got a new life
You would hardly recognize me I'm so glad
How could a person like me care for you?
Why should I bother when you're not the one for me?

I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
Love is demanding without understanding
Yeah I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
And no one's gonna drag you up

Under the pale moon
For so many years I've wondered who you are
How could a person like you bring me joy?
Under the pale moon where I see a lot of stars

I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
Love is demanding without understanding
Yeah I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
And no one's gonna drag you up
To get into the light where you belong

I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
Love is demanding without understanding
Yeah I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes
I saw the sign
And no one's gonna drag you up
Hey!

The Slow Parts on Death Metal Albums
============================================================
Jumping out of my skin
This tiny sector can't contain me
Suit up in a flash
Slipping symbols bravely, bravely
Go where I'm not wanted
Stand where the light hits hard
Almost full grown
Drive home alone and listen to the slow parts

In a new universe
Trying to find the mask that fits me
Shaking the curse
Behaving as the beacons bid me
Denim and leather
Silver strap to please the diehards
Let me dance till I die
Turn the volume up high and listen to thе slow parts

Alien ships from ancient realms (Ships from anciеnt realms)
Ageless captains at their helms (Captains at their helms)
Rage from the sea
Let it begin with me

Half-life of my toxins
Difficult to calculate
Stock up on gauze in case of accidents
Try to keep my story straight
Dozens like me
Never quite free, filling out our dance cards
Mark my time on the wall
Answer the call and listen to the slow parts
============================================================
The Smokey Life
============================================================
I've never seen your eyes so wide
I've never seen your appetite quite this occupied
Elsewhere is your feast of love
I know when long ago we agreed to keep it light
So let's be merry one more night
It's light enough to let it go

Remember when the scenery started fading
And I held you until you learned to walk on air
So don't look down, the ground is gone
There's no one waving anyway
The smoky life is practiced everywhere

So set your restless heart at ease
Take a lesson from these autumn leaves
They waste no time waiting for the snow
Don't argue now, you'll be late
There is nothing to investigate
It's light enough to let it go

Remember when the scenery started fading
And I held you until you learned to walk on air
So don't look down, the ground is gone
there's no one waving anyway
The smoky life is practiced everywhere

Come on back if the moment lends
You can look up all my very closest friends
Light enough to let it go
It's light enough to let it go

Nothing, of course.

The Ultimate Jedi Who Wastes All the Other Jedi and Eats Their Bones
============================================================
Stay true to the path young Jedi,
Cleave to the precepts you’re given.
Remember those who went before and cleared a way for you,
Let your deeds give hope and comfort to the living.
Let your deeds give hope and comfort to the living.

Do your best in city or in swampland.
Peace over anger, honor over hate,
At the end of all your days one Jedi waits for you
With the dust of Jedi bones piled high like parsnips on his plate.
With the dust of Jedi bones piled up like parsnips on his plate.

Specifically just their bones,
All the soft parts you can keep.
“It’s the bones that have the calcium”, so he says.
The long feast will be filmed for mass consumption;
The cameras Rian’s got these days are unimaginably high-res.

Despair not for the end that waits for you,
Fear not the fire in which your flesh must burn.
All the Jedi from all the planets in this putrid universe
Get eaten by this last one and now it’s your turn.
They get eaten by this last one and now it’s your turn.

Bones, bones, bones, bones, bones.
Bones, bones, bones, bones, bones.
The ultimate Jedi who wastes all the other Jedi has eaten up all their bones.
All their bones, bones, bones, bones, bones.

The Water Song
============================================================
Water came springing out the side of the wall
And I guess the same thing will happen to us all
We don't know how to explain what I mean
I mean to say it's kind of hard to explain now

Let them kill me
Let them kill me
Let them kill me
Let them kill me

Water came down through the cracks in the ceiling
But this time the water had a different feeling
It's the sort of feeling that is hard to explain
So, let me put it to you in a different way now

Let them kill me
Let them kill me
Let them kill me
Let them kill me

You're the salesman. I'm the buyer
You're the tractor. I am the tire
I'm the glass. You're the water that fills me
I hear them coming now
Let them kill me

Let them kill me
Let them kill me
Let them kill me now
Let them kill me. Yeah!

Let them kill me
Let them kill me
Let them kill me
Let them kill me
============================================================
The Window Song
============================================================
A knocking sound, it woke me up
But my legs were feeling weak
I stared up at the ceiling and I saw you at the window
But my mouth wouldn't let me speak

I know you
You're the one
I spent three seasons trying
To pretend that I never knew

Something pulled me off the bed
And the same thing moved the muscles in my legs
I moved toward your voice, and my body got so light
I could've walked on eggs right then and not broken a one of them

I know you
You're the one
I spent three seasons trying
To pretend that I never knew

I know you
You're the one
I spent three seasons trying
To pretend that I never knew

I know you
You're the one
I spent three seasons trying
To pretend that I never knew

I know you
You're the one
I spent three seasons trying
To pretend that I never knew

The Wooded Hills Along the Black Sea
============================================================
One, two
One, two, three

Cause no trouble
Keep to our own kind
Known to exist
Hard to find
Neck deep in our passions
Serve who we serve
Enshrouded in moonlight
Bucking the curve

Under the radar
Just out of reach
Among the thick woods
A mile from the beach

The burden of exile
Gets easy to bear
Sometimes forget
There's cities down there
Woodsmen with axes
They come and they go
Snitch to the prefect
'Bout what they don't know
Smell the ocean breeze
We will never run out of trees

Under the radar
Just out of reach
Among the thick woods
A mile from the beach, yeah
============================================================
The Young Thousands
============================================================
Boats ease into the harbor bearing real suspicious cargo
And the sunlight on the water sets a switch off in your brain
The things that you've got coming will consume you
There's someone waiting out there in an alley with a chain

The ghosts that haunt your building are prepared to take on substance
And the dull pain that you live with isn't getting any duller
There's a closet full of almost-pristine videotape
Documenting sordid little scenes in living color

Here they come
The young thousands
Here they come
The young thousands

You drive east from the ocean with both hands tied on the wheel
And you go past Garden Grove as the pleasure index rises
The things that you've got coming will do things that you're afraid to
There is someone waiting out there with a mouthful of surprises

The ghosts that haunt your building have been learning how to breathe
They scan the hallways nightly, vainly searching for a sign
There must be diamonds somewhere in a place that stinks this bad
There are brighter things than diamonds coming down the line

Here they come
The young thousands
Here they come
The young thousands
============================================================
Their Gods Do Not Have Surgeons
============================================================
They came like beasts who'd tasted blood
First a few and then the flood
Coursing over hill and dale
Wet paw prints on their bloody trail
Return the peace you took from me
Give me back my community
Show us the goodwill you were shown
But leave us alone

And restore the temple of Isis at Memphis
Yeah, restore the temple of Isis at Memphis

Their hunger like a worm inside them
No sacred place could be denied them
They who talk all day of beauty
Call all the plain things dirty
Melted holes in celluloid
Give me back what you've destroyed
You who come demanding proof
Let your God rebuild this roof

And restore the temple of Isis at Memphis
Yeah, restore the temple of Isis at Memphis

Make it whole again if you can
Stand in the smoke and say some prayers
Wave your hand

And restore the temple of Isis at Memphis
Restore the temple of Isis at Memphis
============================================================
Then the Letting Go
============================================================
Down in the South Bronx
Down home
Saw you walking down the street again
Saw you looking sweet again

I saw you coming through
I turned my head away from you
Why do you come here
Why do you come around
Why'd you go home
Why'd you head on home to Rockaway
============================================================
There Is Power in a Union
============================================================
There is a power in a factory, there is power in the land
There is power in the hand of the worker
But it all amounts to nothing if together we don't stand
Oh, there is power in a union

Now the lessons of the past were all learned with workers' blood
The mistakes of the bosses we must pay for
From the cities and the farmlands, to the factories full of mud
War has always been the bosses' way, sir

The union forever, defending our rights
Down with the blackleg, all workers unite
With our brothers and our sisters from many far-off lands
Oh, there is power in a union

Now I long for the morning when they realize
Brutality and unjust laws cannot defeat us
But who'll defend the worker who cannot organize
When the bosses send their lackeys, sir, to cheat us

Money speaks for money, the devil for his own
Who'll come to speak for the skin and the bone
What a comfort to the widow, and a light to the child
Oh, there is power in a union

The union forever, defending our rights
Down with the blackleg, all workers unite
With our brothers and our sisters, together we all stand
Oh, there is power in a union
============================================================
There Will Always Be an Ireland
============================================================
Cold northern wind
And your young arm
Against my face
Soft and warm
There will always be an Ireland
There will always be an Ireland

Silent hour
Worthless words
View of some foreign city from the high window
Strange black birds
There will always be an Ireland
There will always be an Ireland

What we did
The things we said
Your hand resting
On my head
There will always be an Ireland
There will always be an Ireland
There will always be an Ireland
There will always be an Ireland
============================================================
There Will Be No Divorce
============================================================
The rain fell all night
And it kept me awake
It was still falling by morning
It was hard to take
And you were sleeping on the floor
Breathing free and even
If I ever want to drive myself insane
All I have to do is watch you breathing
And at 5 AM, I turned the radio on
And an old man's voice sang a short sweet song
And then the static roared again
Hungry for blood
I heard the rain falling from the rain spout
Down, down into the sweet wet mud
And you punched out all the windows
And the wind began to wail
And you gathered your hair behind your head
Like God was gonna catch you by the ponytail
And then the old voice crackled through the static
And I felt young and alive
And the hair stood up on the back of my neck
We were rising from the grave
Yeah yeah
============================================================
They Are Stone Swallowers
============================================================
You went away to Stockholm for a week
You came back with some scratch-marks on your cheeks
The towers line the highway and they cry
From deep down in their guts until they die

The water tower crew are total devils
Toxicity near saturation levels
I rise up and greet the day
See the serpents rising from the clay

You were headed down to Salzburg for the night
All my hair was turning white
You and your crew were good to go
So many people that we'll never really know

I saw the city men, they make me laugh
Digging up the cables, cutting them in half
I watch the ancient sun until it falls
See the serpents coming through the walls
============================================================
Third Snow Song
============================================================
In January, I took the short walk
Down to the Broadway Bridge
Two and a half blocks
When you scrape the ice away
You can read the bridge dedication
I could feel the cold air coming in through my teeth
I saw the bridge, I saw the water underneath
That's a whole lot of water
That's a whole lot of water

I took out the key that I'd forgotten the function of
Twisted it from the keyring as the bridge loomed above
I hammered it against the ice
I hammered it against the ice
============================================================
Thirty
============================================================
My father died when I was thirty.
What ugly savior keeps me here
until eight or so?
============================================================
This Is Heaven
============================================================
I'm trapped inside my heaven.
Softly caged in passion once again.
Like soothing calls from trampled pride.
I want to leave but haven't tried.
I'm bound and burning at the stake.
I've learned I'm bound to make mistakes.
I've taught myself to sleep with hope.
I'm caught, these ropes of comfort tied.
And some percent of give and take will equal seven.
Maybe not.
This must be heaven.

Well it's cold inside my house again
and I hear that sound like rats in cages.
Pounding up against the night
in my brain.
And it seems like years since I've seen you
and the silence of my fears surrounds me.
Screaming up against the night again.

And this is heaven.
And this is heaven.

In a few short hours' I'll still be waiting.
And the sun will rise and burn off darkness.
Beating down upon my neck and face it,
this can't be the morning.
Face the day.

And this is heaven.
And this is heaven.
============================================================
This Is My Father's World
============================================================
This is my Father's world
And to my listening ears
All nature sings, and round me rings
The music of the spheres
This is my Father's world
I rest me in the thought
Of rocks and trees, of skies and seas
His hand the wonders wrought

This is my Father's world
The birds their carols raise
The morning light, the lily white
Declare their maker's praise
This is my Father's world
He shines in all that's fair
In the rustling grass I hear Him pass
He speaks to me everywhere

This is my Father's world
Oh let me ne'er forget
That though the wrong seems oft so strong
God is the ruler yet
This is my Father's world
Why should my heart be sad
The Lord is king, let the heavens ring
God reigns, let the earth be glad
The Lord is king, let the heavens ring
God reigns, let the earth be glad
============================================================
This Magic Moment
============================================================
This magic moment,
So different and so new.
Like any other.
Until I kissed you.
And then it happened.
It took me by surprise.
I knew you felt it too,
By the look in you eyes.

Sweeter than wine,
Softer than a summer night.
The feeling I had inside,
Whenever I held you tight.

This magic moment,
With your lips so close to mine,
Will last forever,
Forever till the end of time.
Whoaaa, whoaaa, whoaaa.

Sweeter than wine,
Softer than a summer night.
The feeling I had inside,
Whenever I held you tight.

This magic moment,
With your lips so close to mine,
Will last forever,
Forever till the end of time.
Whoaaa, whoaaa, whoaaa.
Whoaaa, whoaaa, whoaaa, whoaaa.
============================================================
This Year
============================================================
I broke free on a Saturday morning
I put the pedal to the floor
Headed north on Mills Avenue
And listened to the engine roar

My broken house behind me and good things ahead
A girl named Cathy wants a little of my time
Six cylinders underneath the hood crashing and kicking
Aha, listen to the engine whine

I am going to make it through this year
If it kills me
I am going to make it through this year
If it kills me

I played video games in a drunken haze
I was seventeen years young
Hurt my knuckles punching the machines
The taste of scotch rich on my tongue

And then Cathy showed up and we hung out
Trading swigs from a bottle all bitter and clean
Locking eyes, holding hands
Twin high maintenance machines

I am going to make it through this year
If it kills me
I am going to make it through this year
If it kills me

I drove home in the California dusk
I could feel the alcohol inside of me hum
Pictured the look on my stepfather's face
Ready for the bad things to come
I down shifted as I pulled into the driveway
The motor screaming out stuck in second gear
The scene ends badly as you might imagine
In a cavalcade of anger and fear

There will be feasting and dancing
In Jerusalem next year

I am going to make it through this year
If it kills me
I am going to make it through this year
If it kills me
============================================================
Thucydides II-58
============================================================
Red face at noon
Strip naked but can't get free
And doubling over in the street
Dozens just like me
Spreading like a rumor
Spreading like a rumor

And the doctors come traveling house to house
And they visit the sick each day
Sit with them there until they're gone
Die quicker that way
Save who they can save
On their way down to the grave
Spreading like a rumor
Spreading like a rumor

Run to the altars, beg for shade
Take to the high sea thousand strong
Hang on to your goodness while you can
Sweat it out all night long
And listen for the old melody
As it comes to me
On a high wind down from Ethiopia
On a high wind down from Ethiopia
On a high wind down from Ethiopia
On a high wind down from Ethiopia
============================================================
Tianchi Lake
============================================================
Children by the water banks laughing long and loud
Changbai’s high fine western peaks just beneath the clouds
Currents in the water churning in their course
Body of a sea-lion, head just like a horse

Preacher in the soft brown sand begins to speak his piece
High winds in the treetops, low flying winter geese
No one taking pictures, everybody still
And then the water sought its course again the way that waters will

No one at the lakeside now, moon up in the sky
Night birds in the dragon spruce, moaning long and high
Backstroking on the surface, moonlight on its face
Floats the Tianchi Monster, staring into space

Out around the temple now narcissus in bloom
Censers packed with sandalwood send smoke into the room
Children in the sand outside on their hands and knees
Sketching pictures all day long of stranger things than these
============================================================
Tidal Wave
============================================================
It's not the barnacles that do all the damage
Figure this out too late
It's not the destination that makes the difference
It's the freight

Everything becomes a blur from six feet away
Get used to this
Every card ever turned over remains in play
Get used to this

Not every wave is a tidal wave
Not every wave is a tidal wave

It's not the mutiny written down in the diary
It's the manifest
Forgotten cargo in obsolete measurements
Anybody's guess

Even the proud, even the very proud
Probably die on their knees
Twin masts out on the open seas
Mistaken for trees

Not every wave is a tidal wave
Not every wave is a tidal wave
============================================================
To the Headless Horseman
============================================================
Set out early, every seasoned rider knows
Keep an even pace, steady as she goes
Headed back to town after several nights away
I rode past you on the road again today

Gentle shadows in the mist among the trees
Who awakes prepared to face such sights as these?
God keep the bounty hunter who shows mercy to his prey
I rode past you on the road again today

And as you approached, I could sense the threat
But a stranger's just a friend who hasn't shared their secrets yet

Make camp by sundown, watchfire burning bright
Songs bloom in the dark and throb down in the night
I seek the gate of wisdom, the secret state of play
I rode past you on the road again today

Rise up restless, get ready for the waterworks
Shun the hollow places where my marksman lurks
One of us will tire, and one will rise and ride away
I rode past you on the road again today
============================================================
Tollund Man
============================================================
I was sitting at the edge of the marsh
when the council came to bring me the news.
they handed me a bowl of cooked wild grasses and they
gave me the ceremonial shoes.

goodbye young Danish women.
goodbye Danish sky.
goodbye cold air, I am going away.
goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
============================================================
Tomb of the Assassin
============================================================
I don't remember his name
I just know how old he was when he died
He had a hunger that burned
Day and night he could never be satisfied
And in his dreams he'd see the crosshairs come into view
Woe betide you should they land on you

So we gathered in his name when the moon was rising high above the canyon
And we sang of his successes and of the one time his efforts fell short
When we gathered by the tomb of the assassin

Some people work with a mask
He stood naked to the world all the days of his life
No special weapons or tactics
Just a deep love of money and a pocket knife
Legends never run for their lives
Only the coward survives

So we breathe deeply of the gentle canyon air and raise our tin cups to his memory
And sang prayers that the bones trapped in the rock would reassemble at the judgment
When we gathered by the tomb of the assassin

Calling his memory to mind
Alone amongst our kind
Singing songs of the past
The last of the last

Yes we assembled in his name when the moon was rising high above the canyon
And we sang of his successes and of the one time his efforts fell short
When we gathered by the tomb of the assassin
============================================================
Tomorrow
============================================================
The sun'll come out
Tomorrow
Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow
There'll be sun

Just thinkin' about
Tomorrow
Clears away the cobwebs
And the sorrow
'Til there's none

When I'm stuck with a day that's gray
And lonely
I just stick out my chin
And grin
And say

Oh, the sun'll come out
Tomorrow
So you gotta hang on 'til tomorrow
Come what may

Tomorrow, tomorrow
I love you, tomorrow
You're always a day away

The sun'll come out
Tomorrow
Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow
There'll be sun

Just thinkin' about
Tomorrow
Clears away the cobwebs
And the sorrow
'Til there's none

When I'm stuck with a day that's gray
And lonely
I just stick out my chin
And grin
And say

Oh, the sun'll come out
Tomorrow
Oh, I gotta hang on 'til tomorrow
Come what may

Tomorrow, tomorrow
I love you, tomorrow
You're only a day away
============================================================
Toolshed
============================================================
Out by the tracks where the sunflowers grow high and fine
Three sets of tracks: Steve and Rochelle's and the last one's mine
Guy with a hat down in the weeds in a cardboard box
Secrets to keep, records to seal up
Kittens weighed down with rocks.
There was a little toolshed where he made us suffer

Back at the school everyone looks like the enemy
And we couldn't sleep and I had the voices inside of me
Steve and Rochelle and me down the well all semester long
Back to the tracks to try and make peace
But the box was gone, was gone
There was a little toolshed where the sad man made us suffer
============================================================
Torch Song
============================================================
(We'll just try that again.)
The sun was coming up, and our friend was sound asleep
But we saw through the window that the water ran so deep
That you couldn't make out the ocean floor
Then I saw you in the light
I couldn't take it any more

Give me your hand
Give me everything you've got
And the light from window will fall on us burning hot
Just like a torch

The air was humid; I will not forget
When we stepped outside, I hear your footsteps
Now in my mind, it's a soft sound
Almost imperceptible against the giving ground

Let me kiss your eyelids with my lips
Let me feel the heat coming off your fingertips
Just like a torch
============================================================
Training Montage
============================================================
Water dripping from the pipes down in the basement
Bare feet on a concrete floor
Notches on the wall of my solitary cell
Sweat dripping out of every pore
It feels like it takes forever
It's maybe five minutes on screen
But the horns will swell and the strings will sound
When that flipped quarter hits the ground

I'm doing this for revenge
I'm doing this to try and stay true
I'm doing this for the ones they had to leave behind
I'm doing this for you

Keep cool down in the quiet of the morning
Sweat blood when the sun comes through
Thick mist on the pond before the temple
Headed down for the final rendezvous
Everybody ready for justice
Just another mile to go
But the strings will keen and the horns will cry
When it's just me against the sky

I'm doing this for revenge
I'm doing this to try and stay true
I'm doing this for the ones they left to twist in the wind
I'm doing this for you
I'm doing this for you

I'm doing this for revenge
I am doing this to try and stay true
I'm doing this for the ones we had to leave behind
I'm doing this for you
I'm doing this for you
I'm doing this for you

Transcendental Youth (Song)
============================================================
Cold through broken baseboards
I despise this town
Snow on the sunroof
Two stories down
Hold hands
Wish the snow away
Rise in the darkness
Of the gathering day

Sing
Sing for ourselves alone
Speak into
The microphone

Cedar smudge our headbands
And take to the skies
Soar ever-upwards
On air gone black with flies
Shroud ourselves in the cosmos
Let the music play
Bright star of the morning
Shine on his rising way

Sing
In the night
In the nameless dark
Father long gone
But we bear his mark

Learn some secrets
Never tell
Stay sick
Don't get well

Clutch those broken headboards
Ride the highest wave
Dusky diamonds shining in the far depths of the cave
Try to explain ourselves
Babble on and on
By the time you receive this, we'll be gone

Sing
Sing high
While the fire climbs
Sing one for the old times
============================================================
Transjordanian Blues
============================================================
This church is rotten from the top down
This church is rotten from the top down
But I, I am going to clean house tonight
And it's going to go back into the earth it rose from

These walls can't keep the world at bay
No, these walls can't keep the world at bay
Our time, our time is limited and precious
But this place, this place is limitless and pernicious

Would you all just follow me out into the open
Leave your coats and handbags, damn it all
Can't you see the floors are smoking

And this church is not long for this world
This church is not long for this world
If you're wondering who to blame
I want to praise his name with songs and feasting
Follow me to the open field
Where the truth will be revealed if you're really listening

Hosanna, hosanna, I am saved by the blood of the lamb
One day when I was lost, he died upon that cross
And I am saved by the blood of the lamb
============================================================
Trash
============================================================
Maybe, maybe it's the clothes we wear
Our tasteless bracelets and the dye in our hair
Maybe it's our kookiness
Or maybe, maybe it's our nowhere towns
Our nothing places and our cellophane sounds
Maybe it's our looseness

But we're trash, you and me
We're the litter on the breeze
We're the people on the streets
We're trash, me and you
It's in everything we do
It's in everything we do

Maybe, maybe it's the things we say
The places we go and the music we play
Maybe it's our cheapness
Or maybe, maybe it's the times we've had
The lazy days and the crazes and the fads
Maybe it's our sweetness

But we're trash, you and me
We're the litter on the breeze
We're the people on the streets
We're trash, me and you
It's in everything we do
It's in everything we do

Just trash, you and me
We're the people on the streets
We're the litter on the breeze
We're trash, me and you
It's in everything we do
It's in everything we do
============================================================
Treetop Song
============================================================
All along the interstate
The palm trees were calling out to me
And the line of them stretched down the highway forever
As far as I could see
And I waited 'til the sun was coming up
Light morning traffic and a cool spring breeze
And I heard the old voices calling down to me
From the tops of the trees

When I got up to the top, my head got light
And for a minute everything in the world was alright
And I saw the next tree just 10 feet away
Give or take a few feet I guess
And then I pushed off into the air with all my might
And headed out into the center of the morning light
And I knew that I was gonna make it
The new tree hardly shook to acknowledge my arrival
And I knew that I would be alright
============================================================
Tribe of the Horned Heart
============================================================
You knew that they were out there by the signs they'd left behind
On old abandoned buildings, just some X's and some lines
Half-circles in the concrete, crescents in the snow
You could find the little beacons almost everywhere you'd go

Only people who were sick enough
Knew how to read them right
I got sick when I was seventeen
And I'd hunt down signs all night

You'd listen for the voices in the generator's hum
Hang out behind the power plant and wait for them to come
Hints about their mission in the rustling of the surf
But no secrets can be kept from you if your faith is strong enough

Only people who've been sick too long
Can hold on to the hope
That some friendly ghost is listening to the prayers they learned to say
At the slack end of the rope
============================================================
Trick Mirror
============================================================
Seventeen years ago
They told me to teach him everything I know
I let the fire rain down, rain down
Watched it flare up inside his heart
Saw it tearing him completely apart
Head to toe, I know

And blood will run through the streets of Rome today
And roll across the ocean

Fourteen years ago tonight
Watched him tearing through the garden, killing everything in sight
I let my curiosity get the best of me
I saw the sourceless anger eating at him from inside
No one around him to stem the rising tide
Evil from his head down to his feet
Quinine's bitter
Sugar's sweet

And blood will run through the streets of Rome today
And roll across the ocean
============================================================
Tucson Fog
============================================================
The fog rolled in
And it's never gonna lift, I guess
Breathe against the window facing the street
Scribble with my finger on the glass

Trying to read the horoscopes
Of animals long extinct
Trying to read the omens in the kitchen sink

The fog took shape
Like a golem with a vengeful eye
Limbs like rippling swan's necks
At least a hundred stories high

Trying to read the horoscopes
Of animals long extinct
Trying to read the omens in the kitchen sink

Trying to force an ending
Where everything turns out well
Don't really mind the ritual
Just the smell

Get word sometimes
From distant outposts much like mine
Places where the fog rolled in one day
Try to tell 'em it'll work out fine

Trying to read the horoscopes
Of animals long extinct
Trying to read the omens in the kitchen sink
============================================================
Tug on the Line
============================================================
Sun shone down on a cloudless sea
And we were out on the water, my father and me
With several friends of the family along for the ride
And out on the calm water we killed the motor
And spread our nets wide

Keep your face to the wind and you'll be fine
And wait for the faint tug on the line

Everyone getting restless when we pulled up the net
We dropped it down on the deck and everyone's feet got wet
And the fish that looked like monsters from way down where the water gets cold
Slid down the deck like shuffleboard coasters and made for the hold
Everyone's eyes like saucers, nobody saying a word

Keep your face to the wind and you'll be fine
And wait for the tug on the line

Sailed home in silence across the cold sea
Several friends of the family, my father and me
And something down below deck that we would try to forget
Shapeless and probably nameless as of yet

Keep your face to the wind and you'll be fine
And wait for the faint tug on the line
============================================================
Tulsa Imperative
============================================================
Your momma's failed wheat field
Was a good place to lie down together
Three weeks deep into the guts of summer
We sweat like hogs, and I felt light as a feather

I saw a disk-like object
Reflected in your eye
And the noise grew louder
As we looked up to the sky

And the sleek silver body
Had lights along the side
And the sleek silver body
Had lights all underneath

I remember the warm air
Blowing in our faces
I remember the heat
Running through me

There was no one worth telling
There was nothing we could do, and I was
Real quiet as I lifted the keys from the kitchen table
I was looking right at you

And your hand brushed against mine
And and it shook me inside as
All along the night sky
I watched our futures collide

And the car's new headlights
Cut through the darkness
As the oil dripped silently
To the pavement underneath

I remember the warm air
Burning our faces
I remember the heat
Running through me
============================================================
Twelve Hands High
============================================================
I know you never ask for my opinion
But I'd say that horse is crazy
I know what I think doesn't matter any more
But I'd say his mind is gone
And I know you know what I know
Even though you'd rather die than say it
I know you feel the same way
Or you wouldn't be sleeping on the lawn

I heard the hooves crack the window
Saw the body come through
Saw the big brown eyes flashing
I fell all over you
I got pressure bearing down on me

There was a reason why I came here
But I guess now it doesn't matter
I had a good, good, good, good reason
But I guess now you couldn't care
There is a certain kind of feeling that you get
When you're totally helpless
And there's a different world waiting for me
When I lift my head up from your thick dark hair

I heard the hooves crack the window
Saw the body come through
Saw the big nostrils flaring
I fell all over you
I got pressure bearing down on me

I heard the hooves crack the window
Saw the body come through
Saw the big brown eyes flashing
I fell all over you
I got pressure bearing down on me
============================================================
Twin Human Highway Flares
============================================================
You turned to me and asked me if I'd always be your boy
As we drove across the river into western Illinois
And on the railroad bridge, half a mile of solid steel
Wheels were spitting out sparks, scraping at the rails
Wind in your hair all right
Sunset spilling through the rear window
Your white t-shirt hugging your shoulders, beaded with sweat
On the day that I become so forgetful
That all of this melts away
I will burn all the calendars that counted the years down to
Such a worthless day

As we walked across the parking lot toward the motel office
We were walking with a benediction on us
Light was everywhere, the building stood against the sky
Like a monument to desperation two floors high
A mile and a half from the river
We went back to the car to get our overnight bags
Sunset spilling through your earrings all over your body
When we shut the motel room door behind us, we knew we'd hit the motherlode
On the day that I forget you, I hope my heart explodes
============================================================
Two-Headed Boy
============================================================
Two-headed boy
All floating in glass
The sun it is passed now it's blacker than black
I can hear as you tap on your glass
And I am listening to hear where you are
I am listening to hear where you are

Two-headed boy
Put on Sunday shoes
And dance cross the room to accordion keys
With the needle that sings in your heart
Catching signals that sound in the dark
Catching signals that sound in the dark
They will take off your clothes
And they'll be placing fingers in the notches in your spine
And all, when all is breaking
Everything that you can touch is
Silent, sleeping alone now
Already gone

Two-headed boy
There's no reason to grieve
The world that you need's wrapped in gold silver sleeves
Left beneath Christmas trees in the snow
I will show you and leave you alone
Watching spirals of white softly flow
In the city as you go
They will take off your clothes
And they'll be placing fingers in the notches on your spine
And all, when all is breaking
Everything that you can keep is
Silent, sleeping alone now
And already gone
============================================================
Two Thousand Seasons
============================================================
How have we come to be mere mirrors to annihilation
Whom do we aspire to reflect our people's death
For whose entertainment shall we sing our agony
What hopes that the destroyers aspiring to extinguish us
Will suffer conciliatory remorse at the sight of their own fantastic success
The last imbecile that dreamed such dreams is dead
Killed by the saviors of his dreams
How have we come to be mere mirrors to annihilation
How have we come to be mere mirrors to annihilation
============================================================
Tyler Lambert's Grave
============================================================
Steal west across the country
Under moonlight soft and wet
And let the dead of night hide you
From things you can't forget
Spend daylight in dark tunnels
Where the demons rave
One day closer every day
To Tyler Lambert's grave

Shoplift when you have to
Keep your visor low
And if your hunger shames you
Never let them know
Feel your sadness lifting
Ride it like a wave
That sets you gently down beside
Tyler Lambert's grave

Fall into a pattern
Never get unstuck
Anyone who can't relate
Should thank God for his luck

Young man in a yellow tie
Hair gel in his hair
No context for the picture
Just kind of standing there
Try to step outside the shadow
Of your great catastrophe
Dream all night of freedom
Never wake up free
============================================================
US Mill
============================================================
Way up north
Down the road a little
Back in New England
Right here in the middle
And all way out west

We had our ears to the ground
All of our dreams resting in the same spot
Listening for the old sound
And it was ringing so clear as crystal
And it was shining as bright as gold
Grain gathering on the stone floor
And we were spring-heeled and we were real cold
All summer long
Deep into autumn
In a high room
And down here in the bottom
Down here in the bottom
============================================================
Ultraviolet
============================================================
Down on the Gulf Coast, where they rock and roll
I leaned a little while up against a barber pole
Stood there like that 'til the sun went down
Lost a quart of blood since Tuesday
Light in the doorways
Light up the streets of this town
Ultraviolet
Ultraviolet

And when they cut loose, you gotta stand back
You gotta reinforce the places that they're likely to attack
I spent the whole week down at St. Vincent de Paul's
Wholly immersed in prayer
And ultraviolet
Ultraviolet

Down where the river rushes into the sea
I didn't let 'em get the best of me
I didn't let 'em take the very best part
The last lone bit of light left flickering in my heart
Ultraviolet
Ultraviolet
Ultraviolet
Ultraviolet
============================================================
Un Rêve Plus Long Que la Nuit
============================================================
On a Wednesday, on the 110
I felt the fever rise again
The weatherman east of here predicted rain
I hammered the words into my brain
That you were all I'd ever needed to get by

On the Long Island Expressway
At 4 A.M. on a Tuesday
Humidity like I'd never known before
And you sleeping like a baby, I could hear the engine roar
Somewhere high up above us in the New York sky
Where time means less than nothing, and no one ever dies
Someone knew that you were all there was worth needing
============================================================
Unicorn Tolerance
============================================================
Drawn to the dark
Covered by the blood when possible
Called to the corners
To any open crucible
Easy to reach
Bearing every mark unmissably
Want to leave behind some token of what I carried with me
Search in the storm drains
Sleep in the underpasses
Try hard to look hard
Behind my blackout sunglasses

But I have high unicorn tolerance
I have high unicorn tolerance
I have high unicorn tolerance
I have high unicorn tolerance

Swim with real sharks
Those who never speak when spoken to
Hard limits fade into memory
Once broken through
Scaling the well
Every single day instinctively
Feel shame, real shame
For what my friends must think of me

Dig through the graveyard
Rub the bones against my face
It gets real nice around the graveyard
Once you've acquired the taste
And when the clouds do clear away
Get a momentary chance to see
The thing I've been trying to beat to death
The soft creature that I used to be
The better animal I used to be

Draw where I'm drawn
Seldom wonder why, just follow you
Never blame the rags that swaddled me
For the place the river took me to
Long life to the spiders!
Safe travels to the crow!
Love to the ghosts
Who taught me everything I know

But I have high unicorn tolerance
I have high unicorn tolerance
But I have high unicorn tolerance
I have high unicorn tolerance
============================================================
Unmasked!
============================================================
Rain beats down, down on the outer walls
Down on the skylight, where the streetlights
Shine like unquenchable coals
And I’m up high, trying to say goodbye
The only way I know how
Crude and graceless
Peeking through the eyeholes
Seeing the real you

And just after midnight
When it feels like it's getting late
I will reveal you
I will reveal you

Crowd's half-gone, just a few hangers-on
Come to see me finally tear through the stitching at last
And you don't care, you look almost relieved down there
Like you're free, like you can breathe now
Like they've sawn off your cast
One more sleeper to see through

And by way of honoring
The things we once both held dear
I will reveal you
I Will reveal you

Cast of thousands
But we were the real two
And when I'm alone
Before a mirror late at night
I will reveal you
I will reveal you
============================================================
Until I Am Whole
============================================================
Sunset on Snohomish
Burn the tree line down
Hold my hopes underwater
Stand there and watch them drown
Fishing out their bodies
From the bathroom sink
Leave them in a bucket
Til they start to stink

I think I'll stay here
Til I feel whole again
I don't know when

Trout swim past the fishing lines
Sky gets dark and close
Cars start up and make
Their nightly exodus
On a picnic bench alone
Watch the sky go dark
Dig my nails into my hands
Hope it leaves a mark

I think I'll stay here
Til I feel whole again
I don't know when
============================================================
Until Olympius Returns
============================================================
Go through the motions every day out in the square
Listen for the hidden rhythms on the air
Nod in agreement when the tyrant holds forth
Look for a beacon from the north

Protect yourself
Vouch for every member of the team
This is just a momentary ripple in the stream

Join in the rebuilding, sing loudly at your labor
Make friends with the new guys, be nice to your neighbor
Profess keen interest in the welfare of the state
Taste everything they feed you, say it tastes real great

Spit it down your sleeve
Every time you get the chance
This is just a brief improvisation in the dance

Raise up the columns
Take the statues down
Praise the columns
Spread the word around town

Behold the temple where the old ones stood
Is it not a thing of beauty? Don't it make you feel good?
Is it not a big improvement on the way things used to be?
Is it not a stately beacon for the whole world to see?

We will be right here
On the day it finally burns
Everybody hold a spot until Olympius returns

Yeah!
============================================================
Up the Wolves
============================================================
There's bound to be a ghost at the back of your closet
No matter where you live
There'll always be a few things, maybe several things
That you're gonna find really difficult to forgive

There's gonna come a day when you'll feel better
You'll rise up free and easy on that day
And float from branch to branch, lighter than the air
Just when that day is coming
Who can say?
Who can say?

Our mother has been absent
Ever since we founded Rome
But there's gonna be a party
When the wolf comes home

We're gonna commandeer the local airwaves
To tell the neighbors what's been going on
And they will shake their heads
And wag their bony fingers
In all the wrong directions
And by daybreak we'll be gone

I'm gonna get myself in fighting trim
Scope out every angle of unfair advantage
I'm gonna bribe the officials
I'm gonna kill all the judges
It's gonna take you people years
To recover from all of the damage

Our mother has been absent
Ever since we founded Rome
But there's gonna be a party when the wolf comes home
============================================================
Used to Haunt
============================================================
Tunnel down to the core
Climb through the trap door
Soft pink sky full of rumpled clouds
Radio up loud

There's a pop in the speakers
Where I hear your voice come through
So brave and true
When did I lose sight of you?

Come and rattle your chain
All you want
You're always gonna be welcome
Here in the hallways that you used to haunt

Ride the sentimental rodeo
Down to where the shadows grow
Long while since I felt this way
Stand by the window, wait for day

There's a pop in the speaker
Where I hear your voice come through
So brave and true
Let me never lose sight of you

Come and rattle your chain
All you want
You're always gonna be welcome
Here in the hallways that you used to haunt
============================================================
Vacuum Packed
============================================================
Put out your hand.
I'll give you a taste of the truth.
Here's a dime, call it luck.
Forecast stormy weather.
Set sail.
Put out your hand.
Call it luck.
============================================================
Waco
============================================================
Where the dry dust turns the sunset pink
Where all summer long it's so hot that you can't think straight
Where we pump water from a well by hand
Half a world away from the old promised land
We understand that we've been given
A new covenant, a real sharp one
And we spend our days and nights
Gaining new appreciation of its finer points
And waiting for the dead to rise up from their graves
Waiting for Jesus to come along and save us and
Biding our time
Biding our time
Biding our time as best we know how

Where the Texas Doughboys used to play
Before the wind blew everything away
Where we came to get away from our friends
Where we'd tell each other jokes waiting for the world to end
We know our jokes are funny
But in all the wrong ways
And we rent old George Romero movies
And relish the short time left
Waiting for the dead to rise up from their graves
Waiting for Jesus to come along and save us, yes
Biding our time
Biding our time
Biding our time as best we know how

Wage Wars Get Rich Die Handsome

Floor the pedal at the green light
Watch the traffic all drift right
Barrel forward unimpeded
Switch lanes as needed
Be flexible
Be unreplaceable
In a world of heavy footprints, be untraceable

Wage wars get rich die handsome
Wage wars get rich die handsome
Wage wars get rich die handsome

Live once you get to pay twice
Keep your nose clean
Keep your wheels nice
Open highway on the horizon
Queen of Queens, anima rising
Stay independent
Make adjustments as needed
It's losers all the way down
You stay undefeated, stay undefeated

Wage wars get rich die handsome
Wage wars get rich die handsome
Wage wars get rich die handsome

Wage wars! Get rich! Die, handsome!
Wage wars! Get rich! Die, handsome!

Wait for You
============================================================
When it came time to wait for you
I took the bus to Malibu
Found a cafe by the ocean
Watched the sky for signs

And a rainbow in the west
Wrapped its coils around the earth like a serpent
I felt like I was going to suffocate

And I knew this was not the day
You would finally come my way
But I waited all the same
Watched the water through the window

And a rainbow in the west
Held its head beneath the waves and grew dimmer
Nothing anyone could do, I suppose
============================================================
Warm Lonely Planet
============================================================
Let the stars come out, and the moon shine bright
We're sleeping on the porch tonight
Wind blew all the power lines down
Watch where you step if you go walking around

This may be the night
Our bodies fill with light
And we may hover above
The surface of
Our warm, lonely planet

Let cooling rains come, let them fall
Let the grass grow strong and tall
Let the dandelions breed
Give me what you know I need

This may be the night
Our bodies fill with light
And we may hover above
The surface of
Our warm, lonely planet
============================================================
Washing My Face
============================================================
when you come, if you come
make sure you bring some bubble gum.
and a great big bottle of cheap gin, yeah
don't bother knocking, you can just waltz right in.

when you come, if you do come by
make sure you wear your skirt real high.
there's cracked ice in the freezer
and glasses in the sink
you can lie down on the sofa, and I'll fix us both a drink.
and we will teach ourselves to pray in languages
that we don't really speak.
and we will lie about the way it used to be.

when you come, if you come
bring a couple of coconuts and i'll supply the rum.
and i will dim the lights, pull all the drapes
throw in those near forgotten video tapes.
yeah when you come, if you make it out this far
you better leave your pride out in the car.
and you wanna make sure that you bring along some means for forgetting where it was that we went wrong.
and we will teach ourselves to pray in languages
that we don't really speak.
and we will lie about the way it used to be.

Water Song II
============================================================
They'll be singing out loud
When the water goes through the crowd
They'll be howling for you
When the waves come crashing through

I brought my friend, here he comes
Splashing and gurgling for you
Now the water runs through the streets unimpaired
Crashing through

They'll be saying your name
Every voice different, every word the same
They'll be holding you up
Too close to the sun
But I will make them stop

I brought my friend, here he comes
Splashing and gurgling for you
And now the water runs through the streets unimpaired
Rushing through

They'll start singing, and you'll stand in the light
When my friend gets here, he will set things right
They'll be singing for one thing and they'll get this instead
Let them come and get me, let them strike me dead

I brought my friend, here he comes
Splashing and gurgling for you
Now the water runs through the streets unimpaired
Rushing through

I brought my friend, here he comes
Splashing and gurgling for you
And now the water runs through the streets unimpaired
Rushing through

Water Tower
============================================================
Moving lights on an overhead map
Have to be headed somewhere
There's probably going to be a building burning in town
When you smell smoke in the air
Small hopes are seen to still be small ones
When the hour grows late
And a body floating in a water tower
Is bound to take on weight

Somebody comes bearing the standard
Just when you need to see it held high
You never miss your water
Until you're parched, riding home from the slaughter
Oracles are seen emerging
From the northern mists
And a body floating in a water tower
Is bound at the ankles and wrists

Bound at the ankles and wrists
Marks in the skin
From where the ropes have been digging right in

Men of legend built the cities of the prairie
To rise from the horizon at night
Feel something bigger than me
When I see them trapped in the headlight
Head east, head north by northeast
Get my bearing and know
That a body floating in a water tower
Only has one way to go

Float downstream
Let me float downstream
Floating downstream
============================================================
Waving at You
============================================================
Listen you can tell your lawyer
That he can go to hell
'Cause I can take whatever you're offering up
Reasonably well
And if four long years come to nothing
It's alright
But it's your birthday
It's your birthday tonight

And I went to buy you something
But I caught myself in time
And nothing makes any sense anymore
But everything rhymes

Die hard, die kicking
Old habit of mine
Die hard, die kicking
Old habit of mine
Die hard
Die hard
Die kicking
============================================================
Waylon Jennings Live!
============================================================
Drunk at the Meskwaki casino
Right where God intended me to be
Looking up at the one man in this room
Who's handled more cocaine than me

Think back on the good times just an hour or so ago
Before I got myself this drunk
When the valet parked my rented Mitsubishi
With a beat up old brown suitcase in the trunk

Full of firearms and flash drives
Full of passports
And international money orders
For just in case I make it cross the border

Get a postcard from the gift shop
Let my family know I'm doing fine
Looking up at a map up on the ceiling
To find the place where we all meet up further on down the line

Head back to my table
Get another scotch and soda for the road
The band on stage is really working up a head of steam
Close my eyes and lean my head back, dream a little dream

Full of firearms and flash drives
Full of passports
And international money orders
For just in case I make it cross the border
============================================================
We Bite
============================================================
1-2-3-4!
We walk the streets, I'm out to get you
We bite
Just a feast of gore and blood
We bite
Carnivores live for pleasure
We bite
Strike out like a wolf's endeavor
We bite

And when I get some blood, I rip your throat
Some blood, I rip your throat
I want some blood, I rip your throat
To get some blood

We bite
We bite
We bite
We bite

And when I get some blood, I rip your throat
Some blood, I rip your throat
I want some blood, I rip your throat
To get some blood

We bite
We bite

And when I get some blood, I rip your throat
Some blood, I rip your throat
I want some blood, I rip your throat
To get some blood

We bite
We bite
We bite - here we go
We bite
============================================================
We Do It Different on the West Coast
============================================================
The papers write about it back in England
It's practically a lifestyle in Berlin
There's probably some pockets in Ohio
Almost always something happening in Ohio

I heard some bad reports about Long Island
I don't trust what people say about Long Island
I heard some good things from some friends about Chicago
I gotta see with my own eyes about Chicago

We do it different on the west coast
We do it different on the west coast
We do it different on the west coast
We do it different on the west coast

I heard they had a problem with some skinheads
At a show in a machine shop in Pomona
I feel like half my friends have moved to San Francisco
I think I'm gonna bleach my hair this weekend
And Dave went to New York -- I don't care
You can't shut people up once they get back from their Christmas out there


Skim through such magazines as I can get my hands on
Glue circuit boards to plywood on the weekend
Trellis modulation for the children
There's a whole new world just up around the corner

We do it different on the west coast
We do it different on the west coast
We do it different on the west coast
We do it different on the west coast
============================================================
We Have Seen the Enemy
============================================================
Everything I've told you was true
So imagine my surprise when I blink my eyes
And realize that I've been talking to you
And I've told you everything
Even the parts I'd meant to leave out
And I shake my hair, and I look about

And the wild dogs are hungry
And the wild dogs howl
And the wild dogs in the mountains to the north of us
Come down
============================================================
We Shall All Be Healed (Song)
============================================================
Left home in a blur
Arrived in the night
Everything is going to be alright
Came back to the place
Where it all flared out
Just to check if the reservoir
Still bore the mark of the drought

Up to 13th and Taylor, check my pulse
You weren’t there, and neither was anybody else
Stared down demons, came back breathing
No real point in ever leaving
Tracy and Ivory and Brad and me too
We will see some great miracle before the night is through

Slipped in through the entrance
Stood in the hall
Left my fingerprints on the elevator wall
Went down to my old room
Stood outside it a minute
Wondering if parts of me
Were still there in it

Who can say it won’t be me
You are gone now and I am free
Wesley and Quinn and Devon and you
We will all be fixed up as good as new

And I stared at the number 10 on my old apartment’s door
That’s one ghost that can’t bite me anymore
And someday we will all feel at home in our new skin
And someday we will never be alone again
When the sun comes up and the night has passed
We shall all be healed at last, at last, at last
============================================================
We Were Patriots
============================================================
Clear sky over Calcutta
A warm wind
Dvorak on the short wave
Clear signal coming in
La la la
La la la la la
La la la
La la la la la la la

Long vowels spill like liquid from your mouth
I hang on every word you say
An army of transistor radios on the bookshelf
Left on all day
Let them play
Yeah let 'em all play on and on and on
Let 'em all play longer and louder and
Long after you're gone
La la
La la la la la la
La la
La la la la la

Clear sky sheltering our fragile little house
Listening to the radio all the time
Your hand on my forehead as though to check for a fever
Yeah big plans in mind
La la la la
La la la la la
La la la la
La la la la la la la
La la
La la la la la la
Yeah yeah
============================================================
Wear Black
============================================================
Rain every day
Fog all night
Wind in the evergreen cypresses
See me, Lord of Wind and Rain
See me, guardian of the Underpasses

Wear black when it's light outside
Wear black when there's no light
Wear black following the left hand path
Wear black when I get right

Waves at night
Hard waves at dawn
All this coast is vanishing
Check me out, I can't blend in
Check me out, I'm young and ravishing

Wear black on your forgotten radar
Wear black in the present tense
Wear black when you come around
Wear black in your absence
Wear black high as a kite (wear black)
Wear black dead sober (wear black)
Wear black when the trouble starts (wear black)
Wear black when it's over (wear black)

Sun through the trees
Head for the sun
Can't find the path back to the main road
See me, Lord of The Thomas Guide
See me, Keeper of the Source Code

Wear black to the intervention
Wear black back to the car
Wear black wherever I go
Wear black wherever you are
============================================================
Wedding in Cherokee County
============================================================
There she is
Sittin' there
Out behind the smokehouse in her rockin' chair
She don't say nothin'
She don't see nothin'
She don't feel nothin'
She don't know nothin'
Maybe she's crazy I don't know.
But maybe that's why I love her so.

Her papa was a midget.
Her mamma was a whore.
Her grandad was a newsboy 'til he was 84, what a slimy old bastard he was.
Man don't you think I know that she hates me?
Man don't you think I know that she's no good?
Man don't you think I know she's crazy?
I think she'd kill me if she could.
Maybe she's crazy I don't know
But maybe that's why I love her so

I'm not afraid of the grey wolf
Who stalks through our forest at dawn
As long as I have her beside me,
I have the strength to carry on

Today we will be married
And all the freaks that she knows will be there
And all the people that I know will be there
To congratulate us
I will carry her across the threshold.
I will make dim the light
I will attempt to spend my love within her
But though I try with all my might

She will laugh at my mighty sword
She will laugh at my mighty sword
Why must everyone laugh at my mighty sword?
Lord, help me if you will

Maybe we're both crazy, I don't know.
But maybe that's why I love her so.
============================================================
Weekend in Western Illinois
============================================================
The land's opening up like a blanket
And the dandelions spread themselves thickly out
Along the fields, which are evidently endless
And we are hotly in love with one another
We've got an unquenchable thirst in our throats
We are for some reason all the time bleeding
And we are friendless

And we love these dogs that roll on the lawns here in Galesburg
Because they seem to know something nobody else knows
It is written in the smiles on their faces
And it rings in their high young voices
We are burning up all of our choices up here
Where the tall grass grows
Up here in Galesburg

The sky's opening up like an old wound
And the rain on our bodies is warm tonight
And the ground underneath us shakes in the cracking thunder
We can taste fresh blood in our mouths again
There is no chance of getting enough of it
And we tally up all our possessions, we're going under

Yeah we love these dogs that loll in the rain here in Galesburg
As the new season rocks them in its terrible arms
Yeah they howl as though the world were ending
As we are watching the sky unwinding
And some of our promises were binding up here where our dreams take form
Up here in Galesburg
Up here in Galesburg
============================================================
Werewolf Gimmick
============================================================
I was not there for rehearsal, I don’t need it any more
When I show up just in time to pop you can clear the goddamn floor
Empty out the locker room, let me find my space
Let him who thinks he knows no fear look well upon my face
Nameless bodies in unremembered rooms
Know how a man becomes a beast when the wolfbane blooms

Sail past all the grasping hands, floodlights white and hot
Bring my vision into focus, find out what I’ve got
Some sniveling local babyface with an angle he can’t sell
Full werewolf off the buckle like an angel straight from hell
Nameless bodies in unremembered rooms
Run howling through the carnage when the wolfbane blooms

Half the city sound asleep and safe inside their beds
Get lost inside my thoughts and nearly tear his face to shreds
Blood pooling on the canvas as the atmosphere gets hushed
Bring your heroes to the wolf’s den, watch them all get crushed
Get told to maybe dial it back backstage later on
Everyone still in this building right now: dead before the dawn
Nameless bodies in unremembered rooms
The pure at heart go putrid when the wolfbane blooms
============================================================
West Country Dream
============================================================
Sure as a surgeon
You slipped your hand into the door jamb
Blood coursing through the air tonight
I know who I am
I know who you are
Or who you were just an hour ago
Static interference on the radio tonight
I know what I know

Quick as lightning
You brought your hand back inside
And you shut the door behind you
It's too hot out there tonight
Breath rising and falling
Expansion, contraction
Why'd you tell me this?
Were you looking for my reaction?
============================================================
What Have You Done to the Magician?
============================================================
I taste the air in here
I know the stench of fear
Scope out the exits, get a picture inside my head
Warning signs all flashing red

What have you done to the magician?
What have you done to the magician?
Here where the half-burnt light bulb shines so dim
What have you done, what have you done to him?

You're gone, but you can't be far
Back in the parking lot I've blocked your car
You'll need a tow truck with a flatbed and some long strong chains
I'm here on my hands and knees trying to scrub out the stains

What have you done to the magician?
What have you done to the magician?
Here where we roll the dice and the odds seem grim
What have you done, what have you done to him?

Scratch in the concrete like a mark on the moon
Think as I look at the evidence, it's gonna be my turn soon

Save my description for the cops, but the cops won't come
Promise myself I won't let myself go numb
You can bear out the metaphor if you like, but you won't like what you see
Do everybody a favor this once and let the big one run free

What have you done to the magician?
What have you done to the magician?
Here where the payoff is nothing, and the margins are real, real slim
What have you done, what have you done to him?
============================================================
When Dinosaurs Roamed
============================================================
The dinosaurs, the dinosaurs
They roamed the earth a long long time ago
The dinosaurs, the dinosaurs
They roamed the earth a long long time ago

Some flew so high in the blue, blue sky
Some walked the earth below

The dinosaurs, the dinosaurs
They roamed the earth a long long time ago

Do they have bells to ring or songs to sing
Some things we'll never know
But bells probably not
Maybe some instruments that time forgot
I have heard of stranger things

The dinosaurs, the dinosaurs
They roamed the earth a long long time ago
They roamed the earth a long long time ago
============================================================
When I Get Home
============================================================
Playing in the bricks and the foundry dust
I lost track of time

I'm gonna get it when I get home
He's gonna kill me when I get home

That love should turn to bitterness
All so suddenly
Poison from my pretty songs
Turn to ruin me

I'm gonna get it when I get home
He's gonna kill me when I get home

I know you must have held me once
I saw a photograph
Safe and happy in your arms
A smiling god of wrath

I'm gonna get it when I get home
He's gonna kill me when I get home

One sunny judgment day
I lost track of time
Playing in the bricks and the foundry dust
I lost track of time
============================================================
When a Powerful Animal Comes
============================================================
We move by night
Cover our tracks well, and we pack light
Follow the shoreline when we've run clean out of land
Speak in gestures only we can understand
We've made mistakes
Everyone spots their own mess when the dawn breaks

We get so exhausted
Lost kids, just wasted
Sleep in short shifts and then rise up to our feet
Life is short, and life is hard, and life is sweet
The treeline shakes
We roll hard along some long odds when the dawn breaks

See soft peaks off in the distance
Those people in the mountains—
They will never know what hit them

We shed dead weight
It gets pretty hard to concentrate
Practice our prayers until some small hope crystallizes
Follow the shoreline 'til some better hope arises
Behold, the beast awakes
Stand trapped in his great shadow when the dawn breaks
============================================================
White Box
============================================================
Well I did it now
Oh I did it now
The box said do not open under pain of death
It had my initials there where
I signed my initials on it
On that white box

I saw initials there
Do not open under pain of death
But I opened it anyway
I died anyway
I died anyway
So I come back to stay
Come back to stay
Lord knows I love you anyway
Lord knows I love you anyway
Hey
============================================================
White Cedar
============================================================
Like a star come down to walk the Earth in radiant array
I saw the light of my spirit descend the other day
I was standing by the bus stop on Northeast 33rd
When I got the word
I will be made a new creature
One bright day

I don't have to be afraid
Speed that day on its way
And you can't tell me what my spirit tells me isn't true, can you?

Woke up on lockdown one more time
My visions won't ever learn
But I see the light that much clearer
Every time I return
Forge my armor in the old fire
My spirit sings loud and clear
Even in here

I'll be reborn someday, someday
If I wait long enough

I don't have to be afraid
I don't wanna be afraid
And you can't tell me what my spirit tells me isn't true, can you?
============================================================
White Fence
============================================================
Scratch voice, great.
Nails on the chalkboard grate.
Slash noise.
No more.
Your head pressed through the gate.
============================================================
Who You Are
============================================================
I know your world is full of people who have nothing
Who have nothing to give
Who have nothing to give
I know everyone's trying to sell you the illusion
That keeps them in Hell
That keeps them down in Hell
I'm stuck in my confusion
but I know that you'll go far
You're chased by the horizon
because you know who you are

Hope you remember who you are
Remember who you are

I know they only see you as someone they can use
and someone they pick or choose
and then blame you when they lose
I don't want to be a mistake that only falls off your radar
You can't afford a mistake
because you know who you are

Hope you remember who you are
Remember who you are

All I can give you is one of my stupid songs
and I know it's not the real thing
Wish I could give you the real thing
I'm lost in the sky, but I would bet upon your star
You're alone in this life
Unless you know who you are

Hope you remember who you are
Remember who you are
Yeah
============================================================
Whole Wide World
============================================================
When the last of the repercussions
Died off real slow
The sky was still
And the cold sun sank down beneath the snow
I hung by my hand from the tree outside
And I looked on the whole wide world

When the voices came quietly
I shut them down
When a tricky young southerly wind
Came at me with its high whistling sound
I turned around to face it
With real arrogance burning inside
And I drank in the whole wide world
============================================================
Whon
============================================================
The garbage man is never going to come
The cans out at the curb will bloat and stink
The rot will work its way through cracks in the foundation
The water will go stagnant in the sink
And you, you will know
Where it is that memories go

The migratory birds will not come back
The charms that summer held will all turn sour
And from the treetops when the wind stops
Sweet blossoms will rain down and you will stand beneath the shower
And it will be so clear
You will never quite escape last year

The wind will blow or else it won't
Sometimes you just move on and sometimes you just don't
You think the matter through, you try hard not to think
The water all goes stagnant in the kitchen sink
And you will know, and I will too
What it was I might have left to you
============================================================
Wild Palm City
============================================================
I see five fingers on each hand
I see only as far as my arms can stretch
After that it all gets kinda blurry

I see the air compressor vent where it rises
Up from the hot ground, but I'm not afraid
I see what's coming through
It's you, only it's bigger and better and brighter

I got the sofa set up right here
I got a room, a room full of sand
Open up your mouth and buddy, you'll wish that you hadn't

I feel the new day coming on strong
I see Cindy and she's talking up a storm
I remember her, and I see who she's bringing
It's you, only it's bigger and thinner and wider

I touch the leaves of the plant next to me
They're thicker than they were the last time I touched them
One of them curls quickly around my hand
There are stars up there even when you can't see them
I'll tell you something: that really bothers me
How are we supposed to get anything done
With those stars casting shadows that look just like spiders
Yeah it's you, but this time you're coiled up much tighter
============================================================
Wild Sage
============================================================
I leave the house as soon as it gets light outside
Like a prisoner breaking out of jail
And I steal down to business fifteen-five-oh-one
Like I had a bounty hunter on my tail

And somebody stops to pick me up
But he drops me off just down the block
And along the highway where the empty spirits breed
Wild sage growing in the weeds

Walked down the soft shoulder and I count my steps
Headed vaguely eastward, sun in my eyes
And I lose my footing and I skin my hands breaking my fall
And I laugh to myself and look up at the skies

And then I think I hear angels in my ears
Like marbles being thrown against a mirror
And along the highway where unlucky stray dogs bleed
Wild sage growing in the weeds

And some days I don't miss my family
And some days I do
Some days I think I'd feel better if I tried harder
Most days I know it's not true

I lay down right where I fell, cold grass in my face
And I hear the traffic like the rhythm of the tides
And I stare at the scrape on the heel of my hand
'Til it doesn't sting so much and until the blood's dried

And when somebody asks if I'm ok
I don't know what to say
And along the highway
From cast-off innumerable seeds
Wild sage growing in the weeds
============================================================
Wild World
============================================================
Hold me up baby, for I may fall
Hold my dishrag body tall
Our bodies melt together, we are one
Post-crucifixion, baby
Post-crucifixion and all undone

It's a wild world
It's a wild world
La la la la la la la la la
It's a wild world
Hey, it's a wild world

Church bells ring out the toll of our night
Falling forever forward, forever backward, forever forward, alright
Strophe and antistrophe
Strophe and antistrophe, hey
Antistrophe, come on and kiss me tight
It's a wild world, a wild world
Way up here in your arms tonight

It's a wild world
It's a wild world
It's a wild world
It's a wild world
============================================================
Willin'
============================================================
I've been beaten by the rain
Driven by the snow
I'm drunk and dirty, don't you know
That I'm still willin'
I was out on the road late last night
I saw my pretty Alice in every headlight
Alice, Dallas Alice

And I've been from Tucson to Tucumcari
Tehachapi to Tonapah
I've driven every kind of rig that's ever been made
Driven the back roads so I wouldn't get weighed
And if you'll give me weed, whites, and wine
And you show me a sign
Then I'll be willin' to keep moving

I've been kicked by the wind
Robbed by the sleet
Had my head stoved in
But I'm still on my feet
And I'm still willin'

Smuggled some smokes
And folks from Mexico
Beat by the sun every time I go to Mexico
And I'm still

Yeah I've been from Tuscon to Tucumcari
Tehachapi to Tonopah
I've driven every kind of rig that's ever been made
Driven the back roads so I wouldn't get weighed
And if you give me weed, whites, and wine
Then show me a sign
Then I'll be willin' to keep moving
============================================================
Wish You Were Here
============================================================
So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell? Blue skies from pain?
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?
Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change, did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl
Year after year
Runnin' over the same old ground, what have we found?
The same old fears
Wish you were here
============================================================
Wishing the House Would Crash
============================================================
I was standing outside with my hands in the air
And the scent of gardenias was everywhere
Let the house come down on me
Let the house come down on you

I made my invocation with my eyes on fire
You were there at the window
You are a goddamn liar
Let the house come down on me
Let the house come down on you
============================================================
With Their Flesh He Will Create
============================================================
God itself, for him has always been
A stupid, grotesque person worthless to believe in
With the help of his sick morbidious studies
He denied god's existence with demented theories

He could revive, reorganize
The coldest flesh now dead for a while

Limbs of his forgotten creatures
His creation
Which now awaits
The ominous resurrection

The light of life which through his syringe glows
Soon, in the veins the blood will flow
Injections in a body once deceased, reanimates
The flesh-made puzzle soon will start to breathe
Regenerate

Removing stiffness in every limb
Metabolism of life has started from within

Terrified, he beholds
The rise of his creation
Guided by an artificial soul
Zombified, uncontrolled

Cause with their flesh, he'll create
Yeah with their flesh, he'll create
============================================================
With a Little Help from My Friends
============================================================
What would you think if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key

Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, I get high with a little help from my friends
Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends

What do you do when your love is away?
Does it worry you to be alone?
How do you feel by the end of the day?
Are you sad because you're on your own?

No, I get by with a little help from my friends
Gonna try with a little help from my friends
Get high with a little help from my friends

Do you need anybody?
I want somebody to love
Could it be anybody?
I just want somebody to love

Do you believe in a love at first sight?
Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time
What do you see when you turn out the light?
I can't tell you, but I know it's mine

Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Gonna try with a little help from my friends
Get high with a little help from my friends
============================================================
Wizard Buys a Hat
============================================================
Shuffled up Sixth Street in the rain
Kept my head down as I looked past the people
And in the department store
I found what I was looking for
This is the church
This is the crucible

They come out to Broadway and they look for me
I'm on the red steps smoking a cigarette
Easy to recognize
Black bandages on my eyes
This is the church
These are the congregants

Sun sets on the broad square and lights come up
Feel like this town's gonna put a quick end to me
But if I came here to drown
I'm gonna take a few people down
This is the church
Occupied by the enemy
============================================================
Wizard Level
============================================================
Wake up and recite the lost formula
Scrub my face with cold water at the basin
Sketch forgotten trees inside a little notebook
Commit their names to memory
Trying to get up
Trying to get up to wizard level
Trying to get up
Trying to get up to wizard level

Go walking out behind the house by moonlight
Collect dry stems and leaves and small green pinecones
In a muslin bag I got down at the hardware store
Blessings on the hardware store
Trying to get up
Trying to get up to wizard level
Just trying to get up
Trying to get up to wizard level

Not everybody gets there
Very few can find the path
Go to sleep and dream these holy dreams
Scatter to the wind each day at sunrise
Always catch the sunrise when I can
Held in my heart through trying times
Trying to get up
Trying to get up to wizard level
Just trying to get up
Trying to get up to wizard level
============================================================
Woke Up New
============================================================
On the morning when I woke up without you for the first time
I felt free and I felt lonely and I felt scared
And I began to talk to myself almost immediately
Not being used to being the only person there

The first time I made coffee for just myself, I made too much of it
But I drank it all just cause you hate it when I let things go to waste
And I wandered through the house like a little boy lost in the mall
And an astronaut could've seen the hunger in my eyes from space

And I sang
Oh, what do I do? What do I do? What do I do?
What do I do without you?

On the morning when I woke up without you for the first time
I was cold so I put on a sweater and I turned up the heat
And the walls began to close in and I felt so sad and frightened
I practically ran from the living room out into the street

And the wind began to blow and the trees began to pant
And the world in its cold way started coming alive
And I stood there like a businessman waiting for the train
And I got ready for the future to arrive

And I sang
Oh, what do I do? What do I do? What do I do?
What do I do without you?
============================================================
Wolf Count

Live among the starveling wolves
Get lost inside the pack
Pull at a carcass til my tooth breaks
Your grown-up teeth --
They don't grow back,
They don't grow back.

Find a clearing in the forest
Wait for word from the battlefront
Sing to the moon until your throat's raw
The Lord of the manor --
He won't be coming back from the hunt,
He won't be coming back from the hunt.

Soon, it'll be my time to go,
I know.

Breach the perimeter with my brethren
Know who your friends are when you need them
Sleep soundly with the enemy
And remember me --
Too dumb to trade his cloak for freedom,
Too dumb to trade his cloak for freedom.
Run, run ahead, all of you --
I'll catch up when I'm able to.

Seek the manor grounds anew
Too dark to find the path
Sleep on the road and dream the only dream
Worth dreaming --
The thronging plain,
The bloodbath.

Soon, it'll be my time to go,
I know.

Word on a Wing
============================================================
In this age of grand illusion
You walked into my life
Out of my dreams
I don't need another change
Still you forced your way
Into my scheme of things

You say we're growing,
Growing heart and soul
But in this age of grand illusions
You walked into my life
Out of my dreams

Sweet name, you're born once again for me
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
Oh sweet name, I call you again
You're born once again for me
Just because I believe, don't mean I don't think as well
Don't have to question everything in heaven or hell

Lord, I kneel and offer you
My word on a wing
And I'm trying hard to fit among
Your scheme of things

It's safer than a strange land
But I still care for myself
And I don't stand in my own light

Lord my prayer flies like a word on a wing
My prayer flies like a word on a wing
Does my prayer fit in with your scheme of things?

In this age of grand illusion
You walked into my life
Out of my dreams
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
Just as long as I can see, I'll never stop this vision flowing
I look twice and you're still flowing
Just as long as I can walk
I'll walk beside you, I'm alive in you
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
And I'm ready to shape the scheme of things

Ready to shape the scheme of things
Ready to shape the scheme of things
Ready to shape the scheme of things
Ready to shape the scheme of things

Lord, I kneel and offer you
My word on a wing
And I'm trying hard to fit among
Your scheme of things
It's safer than a strange land,
But I still care for myself
And I don't stand in my own light

Lord, I kneel and offer you
My word on a wing
And I'm trying hard to fit among
Your scheme of things
It's safer than a strange land,
But I still care for myself
And I don't stand in my own light

My prayer flies like a word on a wing
My prayer flies like a word on a wing
Does my prayer fit in with your scheme of things

Don't like going to the doctor
I don't like looking in the mirror
I like looking out the window
Watching the waves break
Do I have to hit you over the head with it
Do I have to hit you over the head with it

Tired of talking to the suckers
I'm tired of talking to the wealthy
I wanna talk to men and women
Who haven't got anything left
Do I have to hit you over the head with it
Do I have to hit you over the head with it

Carry me down to the water
Where I used to play when I was five
Let me go, let me go down to the water
Don't bring me back alive
Do I have to hit you over the head with it
Do I have to hit you over the head with it
============================================================
Wrong!
============================================================
You know, you know
You see what's going on with me
But you don't do anything
You don't do anything
You don't do anything

You feel, you feel
And you hear the time's near
But you don't do anything
You don't do anything
You don't do anything
You don't do anything
Two, three, four

Xolo
============================================================
Looks like rain passed by again this year
Looks like the sky as far as the naked eye can see is completely clear
But the hairless chihuahua who found this place yesterday
Me and him, we will stick around anyway

Looks like you're gone for good
Looks like the steps leading up to the front porch are stained with blood
We stared up into the Mexican sky as though we were searching for gold
And it's vast and inscrutable and cold

Shame shame shame shame on you
Shame shame shame shame on you
Shame on you
Shame shame shame shame on you

Yam, the King of Crops (Song)
============================================================
I felt sick, I felt good
The heat burns with the old wood
Muscles in my arms pump like machines
The Jericho palm trees are plush and green

Bright sun, the new day
I felt sick in a good way
Felt the fever climb when you came down
All the way across town
And you brought me a plate of sweet potatoes

Sun fading overhead
The sunset, bright red
Your green eyes, your smooth walk
Fresh tomato, celery stalk
You cooked pari basmati rice
I felt good, you looked nice
You stood like Galatea over me
You brought fried garlic and kimchi
And you brought me a plate of sweet potatoes
============================================================
Yoga
============================================================
We had our passports out and the kits to fix 'em up with
And the hurricane lamp threw our shadows on the ceiling
I watched them box with one another up there, Punch and Judy
It was lovely, it was awful, it was that kind of feeling

When you said it was real sure
That there was nothing standing in our way
And the lie ran off and hid itself in the alleys
All across Bombay

I saw you knock the lamp over while reaching for the scissors
And I wondered how we'd ever get by without it
And you fell into my arms then, sweet and gentle
Poison in the water, little doubt about it

And you said that one of us
Would be all alone someday
And the truth of it echoed inexhaustibly
Up and down the thoroughfares all across Bombay
============================================================
You're So Vain
============================================================
Well you walked into the party
Like you were walking onto a yacht
Your hat strategically dipped beneath one eye
Your scarf, it was apricot
You had one eye on the mirror and
You watched yourself a lot
And all the boys dreamed that they'd be your partner
They'd be your partner, yeah

Well you had me several years ago
When I was still quite naive
And you said that we made such a pretty pair
And that you would never leave
But you gave away the things you loved
And one of them was me
I had some dreams, they were clouds in my coffee
Clouds in my coffee, yeah

Well I heard that you went off to Saratoga
And your horse naturally won
And then you chartered a Learjet to Nova Scotia
To see the total eclipse of the sun
Yeah, you're always where you should be and
When you're not you're with some underworld spy
Or your best friend's boyfriend
Your best friend's boyfriend
Yeah
============================================================
You're in Maya
============================================================
He hit me right in the face
I drove the Falcon up Towne
Hung out in the library parking lot
The swelling'll never go down
Pint of Hiram Walker in the lining
Of my father's old corduroy coat
Big big plans hatching in my brain and a
Big ugly lump in my throat
I drove up to Harvey Mudd and I played pinball
'till I didn't want to kill anyone
Polished off all my cheap whiskey
And stepped out into the California sun

Singing bainne na mbó ar na gamhna
And the juice of the barley for me
Singing bainne na mbó ar na gamhna
And the juice of the barley for me

My thirst carried me up the coast
Where it only got sharper, goddammit
In a small room that got even smaller
A block away from the Willamette
There was nowhere I needed to go
And nowhere I wanted to be
And my window looked out upon nothing
And nothing looked right back at me
I had a couple of things on my mind
A couple of problems to think through
And I drank 'til I couldn't see straight anymore
Until there was nothing to drink to

Singing bainne na mbó ar na gamhna
And the juice of the barley for me
Singing bainne na mbó ar na gamhna
And the juice of the barley for me
============================================================
You, Sailor
============================================================
No longer will I beneath you shelter
All that you have given
Was never on my behalf
All this, all this and more I cede to you
Swear away in fealty
As I sail for warmer climes

I am a king
You can't deny me my kingdom

What's this camaraderie of country
That turns before me salty
Rust on fragile parts
All this, all this you have inspired
The crew and ship of empire
Rig and mast and spars
Box of stripes and stars

I am a king
You can't deny me my kingdom

You, sailor, on the lonely sea
Will you turn and promise me
You'll always be alive
Oh I might stutter, I might falter
Sail uncharted waters
Drowning, lost, then found
Drowning, lost, then found

I am a king
You can't deny me my kingdom
============================================================
You Take the High Road
============================================================
Taste autumn in the air, you can feel it in your throat
Coming over you now like a warm overcoat
And the rain will be here, and the monsoon
But I won’t be here to see it, you know, yeah

You take the high road and I’ll take the low
And I’ll be in Scotland before you
But me and my true love will never meet again
On the bonnie, bonnie banks of Loch Lomond

You’ve been the best company I’d ever hope to find
You cool my nerves, you ease my mind but
I’m heading off into the setting sun
There’s two of us now, there’s only gonna be one, yeah

You take the high road and I’ll take the low
I’ll be in Scotland before you
Me and my true love will never meet again
By the bonnie, bonnie banks of Loch Lomond

Put quarters on my eyes, demand that I apologize
Buy me a cup of coffee, shake my hand
And wish me good luck, man

Yeah you take the high road, I will take the low
And I’ll be in Scotland before you
For me and my true love will never meet again
On the bonnie, bonnie banks of Loch Lomond
============================================================
You Were Cool
============================================================
This is a song with the same four chords
I use most of the time
When I've got something on my mind
And I don't want to squander the moment
Trying to come up with a better way
To say what I want to say

People were mean to you
But I always thought you were cool
Clicking down the concrete hallways
In your spiked heels
Back in high school

It's good to be young, but let's not kid ourselves
It's better to pass on through those years and come out the other side
With our hearts still beating
Having stared down demons
Come back breathing

People were mean to you
But I always thought you were cool
Clicking down the concrete hallways
In your spiked heels
Back in high school

You deserved better than you got
Someone's got to say it sometime because it's true
People should have told you you were awesome
Instead of taking advantage of you
I hope you love your life now
Like I love mine
I hope the painful memories only flex their power over you a little of the time
We held on to hope of better days coming
And when we did we were right
I hope the people who did you wrong
Have trouble sleeping at night

People were mean to you
But I always thought you were cool
Clicking down the concrete hallways
In your spiked heels
Back in high school
============================================================
You and Me and a High Balcony
============================================================
Clean slate, warm weather
They should tie our ankles both together
Seagulls calling to one another
If a stranger should ask you, you can tell him I'm your brother
Lean into me, press real hard
I got no good reasons left not to let down my guard
I love your kiss, but it's going to come down to this

You and me and a high balcony
And professional wrestling on pay-per-view

Windows in light
And the radio blaring all night
And the truth slowly dawning on me and then on you

Let's pretend we're all alone
Let's unplug the telephone
Our scale doesn't slide
Here comes tonight, hey, open wide

Don't blink, don't try too hard not to
Just rehearse the alibis your father taught you
See the plastic coating on the windows blister
Anybody asks you, tell them you're my sister

Yeah, you and me and a table set for three
Just in case our assassin should finally come through
Anhydrous and matches
Why don't we cook up two more batches
With the time closing in on me and then on you
============================================================
You or Your Memory
============================================================
I checked into a bargain priced room on La Cienega
Gazed out through the curtains of the parking lot
Walked down to the corner store just before nightfall in my bare feet
Black tarry asphalt, soft and hot
And when I came back I spread out my supplies
On the counter by the sink
I looked myself right in the eyes

St. Joseph's baby aspirin
Bartles and Jaymes
And you or your memory

I ducked behind the drapes when I saw the moon begin to rise
Gathered in my loose ends, switched off the light
And down there in the dark I can see the real truth about me
As clear as day, Lord if I make it through tonight
Then I will mend my ways and walk the straight path to the end of my days

St. Joseph's baby aspirin
Bartles and Jaymes
And you or your memory
============================================================
Young Caesar 2000
============================================================
When I was twelve years old, they put me on the throne
When I was twelve years old, they made me king
From the ocean south of here to the northern hemisphere, they gave me everything

Now I’m thirteen, and no one takes me seriously
Now I’m thirteen, and they're trying to take away control
I don't know how stupid you all think I am
But as sure as flowers grow along the western wall, some heads are going to roll
Yeah
============================================================
Young and Endangered
============================================================
Mapmakers by starlight, blunt instruments in hand
Fury and fire the sweet song of the screeching tire all at our command
Follow a path only the faithful can hope to see
There just for a moment breaking the surface hey look that’s me

When we were young and endangered
When we were young and endangered
Not ready to call the danger a threat yet
When we were young and endangered

Pathfinders in wild wood seeking true north
Find what looks like a light in the darkness and head forth
Til you come home I will guard your name
In a sacred place only seen by a few who tended the ancient flame

When we were young and endangered
When we were young and endangered
Not ready to call the danger a threat yet
When we were young and endangered
============================================================
Younger
============================================================
Crank that siren high
Drain the wellspring dry
Map out your coordinates

Send out scouts by day
Dole out mercenary pay
For restless young subordinates

It never hurts to give thanks to the local gods
You never know who might be hungry
It never hurts to scan the windows on the upper floor
I saw a face there once before when I was younger

Set the torch aflame
Call the night by name
Stake out your dark position

Lie in wait
By the gleaming city gate
Try not to lose sight of the mission

It never hurts to give thanks to the broken bones
You had to use to build your ladder

Moment close at hand
Half of you will never understand
And it doesn’t really matter

Big smile on my face
Capsule just in case
Underneath my tongue there

Voices on the breeze
I heard voices once like these when I was younger

Blood rushing to my face
I know that sweet warm taste
And the bitter trace

Storm right down that hill
If I don’t no one will
Follow me right through the chaos

This whole house is doomed
Even the bit-parts get consumed
Prepare a grave for Menelaus

It never hurts to give thanks to the navigator
Even when he’s spitting out random numbers
I knew what those figures meant
And what they hoped to represent
When I was younger
============================================================
Your Belgian Things
============================================================
The men were here to get your Belgian things
They'll store them for you in an airplane hangar
There's guys in biohazard suits
Mud caking on their rubber boots
They've come to keep your pretty things from danger

The men were here to get your Belgian things
They'll spend the whole day hauling them downstairs
I shot a roll of thirty-two exposures
My camera groans beneath the weight it bears

I can see you in my sleep
Playing the points for all you're worth
Walking gingerly across the bruised earth

The men were here to get your Belgian things
They waltzed right through the door and went fluorescent
Their boots were black and shiny and your treasures gleamed like stars
Bones from deep down in the fertile crescent

The arteries are clogging in the mainframe
There's too much information in the pipes
I saw the mess you left up in the east bedroom
A tiger's never gonna change its stripes
I guess
I guess but Jesus what a mess
One way in and no way out

The men were here to get your Belgian things
And only I was here to see them do it
I wish you had a number where you are
It's hard with no one here to help me through it

I can see you in my sleep
Playing the points for all you're worth
Walking gingerly across the bruised earth
============================================================
שקט (Be Quiet)
============================================================
You've been away for quite some time
And now the rules are different,
Now everything's mine
Backtrack. Hey say, what's the problem?
Here's the problem:
Everything's mine

I can't be quiet
I can't be quiet any more
I can't be quiet
I can't be quiet any more
Yeah

You've been away for quite some time
And now the rules are different
Now everything's mine
Backtrack. Hey, what's the problem?
Here's the problem:
Everything's mine

I can't be quiet
